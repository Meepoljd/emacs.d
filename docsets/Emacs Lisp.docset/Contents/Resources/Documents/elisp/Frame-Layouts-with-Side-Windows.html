<h4 class="subsection">28.19.3 Frame Layouts with Side Windows</h4>

<p>Side windows can be used to create more complex frame layouts like those
provided by integrated development environments (IDEs).  In such
layouts, the area of the main window is where the normal editing
activities take place.  Side windows are not conceived for editing in
the usual sense.  Rather, they are supposed to display information
complementary to the current editing activity, like lists of files, tags
or buffers, help information, search or grep results or shell output.

   <p>The layout of such a frame might appear as follows:

<pre class="smallexample">          ___________________________________
         |          *Buffer List*            |
         |___________________________________|
         |     |                       |     |
         |  *  |                       |  *  |
         |  d  |                       |  T  |
         |  i  |                       |  a  |
         |  r  |   Main Window Area    |  g  |
         |  e  |                       |  s  |
         |  d  |                       |  *  |
         |  *  |                       |     |
         |_____|_______________________|_____|
         | *help*/*grep*/  |  *shell*/       |
         | *Completions*   |  *compilation*  |
         |_________________|_________________|
         |             Echo Area             |

   <p>The following example illustrates how window parameters (see <a href="Window-Parameters.html#Window-Parameters">Window Parameters</a>) can be used with <code>display-buffer-in-side-window</code>
(see <a href="Displaying-Buffers-in-Side-Windows.html#Displaying-Buffers-in-Side-Windows">Displaying Buffers in Side Windows</a>) to set up code for
producing the frame layout sketched above.

<pre class="example">     (defvar parameters
       '(window-parameters . ((no-other-window . t)
                              (no-delete-other-windows . t))))
     
     (setq fit-window-to-buffer-horizontally t)
     (setq window-resize-pixelwise t)
     
     (setq
      display-buffer-alist
      `(("\\*Buffer List\\*" display-buffer-in-side-window
         (side . top) (slot . 0) (window-height . fit-window-to-buffer)
         (preserve-size . (nil . t)) ,parameters)
        ("\\*Tags List\\*" display-buffer-in-side-window
         (side . right) (slot . 0) (window-width . fit-window-to-buffer)
         (preserve-size . (t . nil)) ,parameters)
        ("\\*\\(?:help\\|grep\\|Completions\\)\\*"
         display-buffer-in-side-window
         (side . bottom) (slot . -1) (preserve-size . (nil . t))
         ,parameters)
        ("\\*\\(?:shell\\|compilation\\)\\*" display-buffer-in-side-window
         (side . bottom) (slot . 1) (preserve-size . (nil . t))
         ,parameters)))
</pre>
   <p>This specifies <code>display-buffer-alist</code> entries (see <a href="Choosing-Window.html#Choosing-Window">Choosing Window</a>) for buffers with fixed names.  In particular, it asks for
showing <samp><span class="file">*Buffer List*</span></samp> with adjustable height at the top of the
frame and <samp><span class="file">*Tags List*</span></samp> with adjustable width on the frame's right. 
It also asks for having the <samp><span class="file">*help*</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">*grep*</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">*Completions*</span></samp> buffers share a window on the bottom left side of
the frame and the <samp><span class="file">*shell*</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">*compilation*</span></samp> buffers appear
in a window on the bottom right side of the frame.

   <p>Note that the option <code>fit-window-to-buffer-horizontally</code> must
have a non-<code>nil</code> value in order to allow horizontal adjustment of
windows.  Entries are also added that ask for preserving the height of
side windows at the top and bottom of the frame and the width of side
windows at the left or right of the frame.  To assure that side windows
retain their respective sizes when maximizing the frame, the variable
<code>window-resize-pixelwise</code> is set to a non-<code>nil</code> value. 
See <a href="Resizing-Windows.html#Resizing-Windows">Resizing Windows</a>.

   <p>The last form also makes sure that none of the created side windows
are accessible via <kbd>C-x o</kbd> by installing the <code>no-other-window</code>
parameter for each of these windows.  In addition, it makes sure that
side windows are not deleted via <kbd>C-x 1</kbd> by installing the
<code>no-delete-other-windows</code> parameter for each of these windows.

   <p>Since <code>dired</code> buffers have no fixed names, we use a special
function <code>dired-default-directory-on-left</code> in order to display a
lean directory buffer on the left side of the frame.

<pre class="example">     (defun dired-default-directory-on-left ()
       "Display `default-directory' in side window on left, hiding details."
       (interactive)
       (let ((buffer (dired-noselect default-directory)))
         (with-current-buffer buffer (dired-hide-details-mode t))
         (display-buffer-in-side-window
          buffer `((side . left) (slot . 0)
                   (window-width . fit-window-to-buffer)
                   (preserve-size . (t . nil)) ,parameters))))
</pre>
   <p>Evaluating the preceding forms and typing, in any order, <kbd>M-x&nbsp;list-buffers</kbd><!-- /@w -->, <kbd>C-h f</kbd>, <kbd>M-x shell</kbd>, <kbd>M-x&nbsp;list-tags</kbd><!-- /@w -->,
and <kbd>M-x dired-default-directory-on-left</kbd> should now reproduce the
frame layout sketched above.
