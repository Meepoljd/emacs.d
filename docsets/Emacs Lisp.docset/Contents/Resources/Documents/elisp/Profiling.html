<h3 class="section">18.5 Profiling</h3>

<p><a name="index-profiling-1327"></a><a name="index-profile-1328"></a><a name="index-performance-analysis-1329"></a><a name="index-measuring-resource-usage-1330"></a><a name="index-memory-usage-1331"></a>
If your program is working correctly, but not fast enough, and you
want to make it run more quickly or efficiently, the first thing to do
is <dfn>profile</dfn> your code so that you know where it spends most of
the execution time.  If you find that one particular function is
responsible for a significant portion of the execution time, you can
start looking for ways to optimize that piece.

   <p>Emacs has built-in support for this.  To begin profiling, type
<kbd>M-x profiler-start</kbd>.  You can choose to profile by processor
usage, memory usage, or both.  Then run the code you'd like to speed
up.  After that, type <kbd>M-x profiler-report</kbd> to display a summary
buffer for each resource (cpu and memory) that you chose to profile. 
The names of the report buffers include the times at which the reports
were generated, so you can generate another report later on without
erasing previous results.  When you have finished profiling, type
<kbd>M-x profiler-stop</kbd> (there is a small overhead associated with
profiling, so we don't recommend leaving it active except when you are
actually running the code you want to examine).

   <p>The profiler report buffer shows, on each line, a function that was
called, followed by how much resources (cpu or memory) it used in
absolute and percentage terms since profiling started.  If a given
line has a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; symbol at the left-hand side, you can expand that
line by typing <kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>, in order to see the function(s) called
by the higher-level function.  Use a prefix argument (<kbd>C-u
&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>) to see the whole call tree below a function.  Pressing
<kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> again will collapse back to the original state.

   <p>Press <kbd>j</kbd> or <kbd>mouse-2</kbd> to jump to the definition of a function
at point.  Press <kbd>d</kbd> to view a function's documentation.  You can
save a profile to a file using <kbd>C-x C-w</kbd>.  You can compare two
profiles using <kbd>=</kbd>.

<!-- FIXME reversed calltree? -->
   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007belp_002eel_007d-1332"></a><a name="index-timing-programs-1333"></a>The <samp><span class="file">elp</span></samp> library offers an alternative approach, which is useful
when you know in advance which Lisp function(s) you want to profile. 
Using that library, you begin by setting <code>elp-function-list</code> to
the list of function symbols&mdash;those are the functions you want to
profile.  Then type <kbd>M-x&nbsp;elp-instrument-list&nbsp;&lt;RET&gt;&nbsp;nil&nbsp;&lt;RET&gt;</kbd><!-- /@w --> to arrange for profiling those functions.  After running
the code you want to profile, invoke <kbd>M-x&nbsp;elp-results</kbd><!-- /@w --> to
display the current results.  See the file <samp><span class="file">elp.el</span></samp> for more
detailed instructions.  This approach is limited to profiling
functions written in Lisp, it cannot profile Emacs primitives.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bbenchmark_002eel_007d-1334"></a><a name="index-benchmarking-1335"></a>You can measure the time it takes to evaluate individual Emacs Lisp
forms using the <samp><span class="file">benchmark</span></samp> library.  See the macros
<code>benchmark-run</code> and <code>benchmark-run-compiled</code> in
<samp><span class="file">benchmark.el</span></samp>.  You can also use the <code>benchmark</code> command
for timing forms interactively.

<!-- Not worth putting in the printed manual. -->
   <p><a name="index-g_t_002d_002denable_002dprofiling-option-of-configure-1336"></a>To profile Emacs at the level of its C code, you can build it using the
<samp><span class="option">--enable-profiling</span></samp> option of <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>.  When Emacs
exits, it generates a file <samp><span class="file">gmon.out</span></samp> that you can examine using
the <samp><span class="command">gprof</span></samp> utility.  This feature is mainly useful for
debugging Emacs.  It actually stops the Lisp-level <kbd>M-x
profiler-...</kbd> commands described above from working.
