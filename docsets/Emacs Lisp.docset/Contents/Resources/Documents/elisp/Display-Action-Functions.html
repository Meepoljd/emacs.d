<h3 class="section">28.14 Action Functions for <code>display-buffer</code></h3>

<p>The following basic action functions are defined in Emacs.  Each of
these functions takes two arguments: <var>buffer</var>, the buffer to
display, and <var>alist</var>, an action alist.  Each action function
returns the window if it succeeds, and <code>nil</code> if it fails.

</p><div class="defun">
— Function: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Function/display%2Dbuffer%2Dsame%2Dwindow"></a><b>display-buffer-same-window</b><var> buffer alist<a name="index-display_002dbuffer_002dsame_002dwindow-2739"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function tries to display <var>buffer</var> in the selected window. 
It fails if the selected window is a minibuffer window or is dedicated
to another buffer (see <a href="Dedicated-Windows.html#Dedicated-Windows">Dedicated Windows</a>).  It also fails if
<var>alist</var> has a non-<code>nil</code> <code>inhibit-same-window</code> entry. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
— Function: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Function/display%2Dbuffer%2Dreuse%2Dwindow"></a><b>display-buffer-reuse-window</b><var> buffer alist<a name="index-display_002dbuffer_002dreuse_002dwindow-2740"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function tries to display <var>buffer</var> by finding a window
that is already displaying it.

        </p><p>If <var>alist</var> has a non-<code>nil</code> <code>inhibit-same-window</code> entry,
the selected window is not eligible for reuse.  If <var>alist</var>
contains a <code>reusable-frames</code> entry, its value determines which
frames to search for a reusable window:

          </p><ul>
<li><code>nil</code> means consider windows on the selected frame. 
(Actually, the last non-minibuffer frame.) 
</li><li><code>t</code> means consider windows on all frames. 
</li><li><code>visible</code> means consider windows on all visible frames. 
</li><li>0 means consider windows on all visible or iconified frames. 
</li><li>A frame means consider windows on that frame only. 
</li></ul>

        <p>Note that these meanings differ slightly from those of the
<var>all-frames</var> argument to <code>next-window</code> (see <a href="Cyclic-Window-Ordering.html#Cyclic-Window-Ordering">Cyclic Window Ordering</a>).

        </p><p>If <var>alist</var> contains no <code>reusable-frames</code> entry, this function
normally searches just the selected frame; however, if the variable
<code>pop-up-frames</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, it searches all frames on the
current terminal.  See <a href="Choosing-Window-Options.html#Choosing-Window-Options">Choosing Window Options</a>.

        </p><p>If this function chooses a window on another frame, it makes that frame
visible and, unless <var>alist</var> contains an <code>inhibit-switch-frame</code>
entry (see <a href="Choosing-Window-Options.html#Choosing-Window-Options">Choosing Window Options</a>), raises that frame if necessary. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">

<blockquote><p>This function tries to display <var>buffer</var> by finding a window
that is displaying a buffer in a given mode.

        </p><p>If <var>alist</var> contains a <code>mode</code> entry, its value is a major mode
(a symbol) or a list of major modes.  If <var>alist</var> contains no
<code>mode</code> entry, the current major mode of <var>buffer</var> is used.  A
window is a candidate if it displays a buffer that derives from one of
the given modes.

        </p><p>The behavior is also controlled by entries for
<code>inhibit-same-window</code>, <code>reusable-frames</code> and
<code>inhibit-switch-frame</code> as is done in the function
<code>display-buffer-reuse-window</code>.

<blockquote><p>This function creates a new frame, and displays the buffer in that
frame's window.  It actually performs the frame creation by calling
the function specified in <code>pop-up-frame-function</code>
(see <a href="Choosing-Window-Options.html#Choosing-Window-Options">Choosing Window Options</a>).  If <var>alist</var> contains a
<code>pop-up-frame-parameters</code> entry, the associated value
is added to the newly created frame's parameters.

<div class="defun">

<blockquote><p>This function tries to display <var>buffer</var> in a child frame
(see <a href="Child-Frames.html#Child-Frames">Child Frames</a>) of the selected frame, either reusing an existing
child frame or by making a new one.  If <var>alist</var> has a non-<code>nil</code>
<code>child-frame-parameters</code> entry, the corresponding value is an alist
of frame parameters to give the new frame.  A <code>parent-frame</code>
parameter specifying the selected frame is provided by default.  If the
child frame should be or become the child of another frame, a
corresponding entry must be added to <var>alist</var>.

        </p><p>The appearance of child frames is largely dependent on the parameters
provided via <var>alist</var>.  It is advisable to use at least ratios to
specify the size (see <a href="Size-Parameters.html#Size-Parameters">Size Parameters</a>) and the position
(see <a href="Position-Parameters.html#Position-Parameters">Position Parameters</a>) of the child frame and to add the
<code>keep-ratio</code> in order to make sure that the child frame remains
visible.  For other parameters that should be considered see <a href="Child-Frames.html#Child-Frames">Child Frames</a>.

        </p><p>If <var>alist</var> has a non-<code>nil</code> <code>frame-predicate</code> entry, its

non-<code>nil</code> if the frame is a candidate; this function replaces the
default predicate.

<blockquote><p>This function tries to display <var>buffer</var> by splitting the largest
or least recently-used window (typically one on the selected frame). 
It actually performs the split by calling the function specified in
<code>split-window-preferred-function</code> (see <a href="Choosing-Window-Options.html#Choosing-Window-Options">Choosing Window Options</a>).

        </p><p>The size of the new window can be adjusted by supplying
<code>window-height</code> and <code>window-width</code> entries in <var>alist</var>.  To
adjust the window's height, use an entry whose <span class="sc">car</span> is
<code>window-height</code> and whose <span class="sc">cdr</span> is one of:

          </p><ul>
<li><code>nil</code> means to leave the height of the new window alone.

          </li><li>A number specifies the desired height of the new window.  An integer
specifies the number of lines of the window.  A floating-point
number gives the fraction of the window's height with respect to the
height of the frame's root window.

          </li><li>If the <span class="sc">cdr</span> specifies a function, that function is called with one
argument: the new window.  The function is supposed to adjust the
height of the window; its return value is ignored.  Suitable functions
are <code>shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer</code> and
<code>fit-window-to-buffer</code>, see <a href="Resizing-Windows.html#Resizing-Windows">Resizing Windows</a>. 
</li></ul>

        <p>To adjust the window's width, use an entry whose <span class="sc">car</span> is
<code>window-width</code> and whose <span class="sc">cdr</span> is one of:

          </p><ul>
<li><code>nil</code> means to leave the width of the new window alone.

          </li><li>A number specifies the desired width of the new window.  An integer
specifies the number of columns of the window.  A floating-point
number gives the fraction of the window's width with respect to the
width of the frame's root window.

          </li><li>If the <span class="sc">cdr</span> specifies a function, that function is called with one
argument: the new window.  The function is supposed to adjust the width
of the window; its return value is ignored. 
</li></ul>

        <p>If <var>alist</var> contains a <code>preserve-size</code> entry, Emacs will try to
preserve the size of the new window during future resize operations
(see <a href="Preserving-Window-Sizes.html#Preserving-Window-Sizes">Preserving Window Sizes</a>).  The <span class="sc">cdr</span> of that entry must be a
cons cell whose <span class="sc">car</span>, if non-<code>nil</code>, means to preserve the width
of the window and whose <span class="sc">cdr</span>, if non-<code>nil</code>, means to preserve
the height of the window.

        </p><p>This function can fail if no window splitting can be performed for some
reason (e.g., if the selected frame has an <code>unsplittable</code> frame
parameter; see <a href="Buffer-Parameters.html#Buffer-Parameters">Buffer Parameters</a>).

by splitting the selected one and display <var>buffer</var> there.  It will
also adjust that window's size provided <var>alist</var> contains a suitable
<code>window-height</code> or <code>window-width</code> entry, see above.

<blockquote><p>This function tries to display <var>buffer</var> by choosing an existing

<blockquote><p>If <var>alist</var> has a non-<code>nil</code> <code>allow-no-window</code> entry, then
this function does not display <code>buffer</code>.  This allows you to
override the default action and avoid displaying the buffer.  It is
assumed that when the caller specifies a non-<code>nil</code>
<code>allow-no-window</code> value it can handle a <code>nil</code> value returned
from <code>display-buffer</code> in this case. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>If the <var>alist</var> argument of any of these functions contains a
<code>window-parameters</code> entry, <code>display-buffer</code> assigns the
elements of the associated value as window parameters of the chosen
window.

   </p><p>To illustrate the use of action functions, consider the following
example.

</p><pre class="example">     (display-buffer
      (get-buffer-create "*foo*")
      '((display-buffer-reuse-window
         display-buffer-pop-up-window
         display-buffer-pop-up-frame)
        (reusable-frames . 0)
        (window-height . 10) (window-width . 40)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Evaluating the form above will cause <code>display-buffer</code> to proceed as
follows: If a buffer called *foo* already appears on a visible or
iconified frame, it will reuse its window.  Otherwise, it will try to
pop up a new window or, if that is impossible, a new frame and show the
buffer there.  If all these steps fail, it will proceed using whatever
<code>display-buffer-base-action</code> and
<code>display-buffer-fallback-action</code> prescribe.

   </p><p>Furthermore, <code>display-buffer</code> will try to adjust a reused window
(provided *foo* was put by <code>display-buffer</code> there before) or a
popped-up window as follows: If the window is part of a vertical
combination, it will set its height to ten lines.  Note that if, instead
of the number 10, we specified the function
<code>fit-window-to-buffer</code>, <code>display-buffer</code> would come up with a
one-line window to fit the empty buffer.  If the window is part of a
horizontal combination, it sets its width to 40 columns.  Whether a new
window is vertically or horizontally combined depends on the shape of
the window split and the values of
<code>split-window-preferred-function</code>, <code>split-height-threshold</code>
and <code>split-width-threshold</code> (see <a href="Choosing-Window-Options.html#Choosing-Window-Options">Choosing Window Options</a>).

   </p><p>Now suppose we combine this call with a preexisting setup for
<code>display-buffer-alist</code> as follows.

</p><pre class="example">     (let ((display-buffer-alist
            (cons
             '("\\*foo\\*"
               (display-buffer-reuse-window display-buffer-below-selected)
               (reusable-frames)
               (window-height . 5))
             display-buffer-alist)))
       (display-buffer
        (get-buffer-create "*foo*")
        '((display-buffer-reuse-window
           display-buffer-pop-up-window
           display-buffer-pop-up-frame)
          (reusable-frames . 0)
          (window-height . 10) (window-width . 40))))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This form will have <code>display-buffer</code> first try reusing a window
that shows *foo* on the selected frame.  If there's no such window, it
will try to split the selected window or, if that is impossible, use the
window below the selected window.

   </p><p>If there's no window below the selected one, or the window below the
selected one is dedicated to its buffer, <code>display-buffer</code> will
proceed as described in the previous example.  Note, however, that when
it tries to adjust the height of any reused or popped-up window, it will
in any case try to set its number of lines to 5 since that value
overrides the corresponding specification in the <var>action</var> argument
of <code>display-buffer</code>.
