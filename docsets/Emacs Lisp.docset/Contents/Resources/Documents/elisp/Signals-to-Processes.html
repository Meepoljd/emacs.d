<h3 class="section">38.8 Sending Signals to Processes</h3>

<p><a name="index-process-signals-4329"></a><a name="index-sending-signals-4330"></a><a name="index-signals-4331"></a>
  <dfn>Sending a signal</dfn> to a subprocess is a way of interrupting its
activities.  There are several different signals, each with its own
meaning.  The set of signals and their names is defined by the operating
system.  For example, the signal <code>SIGINT</code> means that the user has
typed <kbd>C-c</kbd>, or that some analogous thing has happened.

   </p><p>Each signal has a standard effect on the subprocess.  Most signals
kill the subprocess, but some stop (or resume) execution instead.  Most
signals can optionally be handled by programs; if the program handles
the signal, then we can say nothing in general about its effects.

   </p><p>You can send signals explicitly by calling the functions in this
section.  Emacs also sends signals automatically at certain times:
killing a buffer sends a <code>SIGHUP</code> signal to all its associated
processes; killing Emacs sends a <code>SIGHUP</code> signal to all remaining
processes.  (<code>SIGHUP</code> is a signal that usually indicates that the
user “hung up the phone”, i.e., disconnected.)

   </p><p>Each of the signal-sending functions takes two optional arguments:
<var>process</var> and <var>current-group</var>.

   </p><p>The argument <var>process</var> must be either a process, a process
name, a buffer, a buffer name, or <code>nil</code>.  A buffer or buffer name
stands for a process through <code>get-buffer-process</code>.  <code>nil</code>
stands for the process associated with the current buffer.  Except
with <code>stop-process</code> and <code>continue-process</code>, an error is
signaled if <var>process</var> does not identify an active process, or if
it represents a network, serial, or pipe connection.

   </p><p>The argument <var>current-group</var> is a flag that makes a difference
when you are running a job-control shell as an Emacs subprocess.  If it
is non-<code>nil</code>, then the signal is sent to the current process-group
of the terminal that Emacs uses to communicate with the subprocess.  If
the process is a job-control shell, this means the shell's current
subjob.  If <var>current-group</var> is <code>nil</code>, the signal is
sent to the process group of the immediate subprocess of Emacs.  If
the subprocess is a job-control shell, this is the shell itself.  If
<var>current-group</var> is <code>lambda</code>, the signal is sent to the
process-group that owns the terminal, but only if it is not the shell
itself.

   </p><p>The flag <var>current-group</var> has no effect when a pipe is used to
communicate with the subprocess, because the operating system does not
support the distinction in the case of pipes.  For the same reason,
job-control shells won't work when a pipe is used.  See
<code>process-connection-type</code> in <a href="Asynchronous-Processes.html#Asynchronous-Processes">Asynchronous Processes</a>.

character (normally <kbd>C-c</kbd> on some systems, and &lt;DEL&gt; on
others) sends this signal.  When the argument <var>current-group</var> is
non-<code>nil</code>, you can think of this function as typing <kbd>C-c</kbd>
on the terminal by which Emacs talks to the subprocess.

<blockquote><p>This function kills the process <var>process</var> by sending the
signal <code>SIGKILL</code>.  This signal kills the subprocess immediately,
and cannot be handled by the subprocess. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<blockquote><p>This function sends the signal <code>SIGQUIT</code> to the process
<var>process</var>.  This signal is the one sent by the quit
character (usually <kbd>C-\</kbd>) when you are not inside
Emacs.

<div class="defun">
— Function: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Function/stop%2Dprocess"></a><b>stop-process</b><var> &amp;optional process current-group<a name="index-stop_002dprocess-4335"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function stops the specified <var>process</var>.  If it is a real
subprocess running a program, it sends the signal <code>SIGTSTP</code> to
that subprocess.  If <var>process</var> represents a network, serial, or
pipe connection, this function inhibits handling of the incoming data
from the connection; for a network server, this means not accepting
new connections.  Use <code>continue-process</code> to resume normal
execution.

        </p><p>Outside of Emacs, on systems with job control, the stop character
(usually <kbd>C-z</kbd>) normally sends the <code>SIGTSTP</code> signal to a
subprocess.  When <var>current-group</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, you can think
of this function as typing <kbd>C-z</kbd> on the terminal Emacs uses to
communicate with the subprocess.

<div class="defun">

<blockquote><p>This function resumes execution of the process <var>process</var>.  If it
is a real subprocess running a program, it sends the signal
<code>SIGCONT</code> to that subprocess; this presumes that <var>process</var>
was stopped previously.  If <var>process</var> represents a network,
serial, or pipe connection, this function resumes handling of the
incoming data from the connection.  For serial connections, data that
arrived during the time the process was stopped might be lost. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
— Command: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/signal%2Dprocess"></a><b>signal-process</b><var> process signal<a name="index-signal_002dprocess-4337"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function sends a signal to process <var>process</var>.  The argument
<var>signal</var> specifies which signal to send; it should be an integer,
or a symbol whose name is a signal.

        </p><p>The <var>process</var> argument can be a system process <acronym>ID</acronym> (an
integer); that allows you to send signals to processes that are not
children of Emacs.  See <a href="System-Processes.html#System-Processes">System Processes</a>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Sometimes, it is necessary to send a signal to a non-local
asynchronous process.  This is possible by writing an own
<code>interrupt-process</code> implementation.  This function must be added
then to <code>interrupt-process-functions</code>.

default function, which shall always be the last in this list, is
<code>internal-default-interrupt-process</code>.
