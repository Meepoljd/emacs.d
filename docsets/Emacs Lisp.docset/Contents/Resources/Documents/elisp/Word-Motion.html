<h4 class="subsection">30.2.2 Motion by Words</h4>

<p>The functions for parsing words described below use the syntax table
and <code>char-script-table</code> to decide whether a given character is
part of a word.  See <a href="Syntax-Tables.html#Syntax-Tables">Syntax Tables</a>, and see <a href="Character-Properties.html#Character-Properties">Character Properties</a>.

</p><div class="defun">
— Command: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/forward%2Dword"></a><b>forward-word</b><var> &amp;optional count<a name="index-forward_002dword-3322"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function moves point forward <var>count</var> words (or backward if
<var>count</var> is negative).  If <var>count</var> is omitted or <code>nil</code>, it
defaults to 1.  In an interactive call, <var>count</var> is specified by
the numeric prefix argument.

        </p><p>“Moving one word” means moving until point crosses a
word-constituent character, which indicates the beginning of a word,
and then continue moving until the word ends.  By default, characters
that begin and end words, known as <dfn>word boundaries</dfn>, are defined
by the current buffer's syntax table (see <a href="Syntax-Class-Table.html#Syntax-Class-Table">Syntax Class Table</a>), but
modes can override that by setting up a suitable
<code>find-word-boundary-function-table</code>, described below.  Characters
that belong to different scripts (as defined by
<code>char-script-table</code>), also define a word boundary
(see <a href="Character-Properties.html#Character-Properties">Character Properties</a>).  In any case, this function cannot
move point past the boundary of the accessible portion of the buffer,
or across a field boundary (see <a href="Fields.html#Fields">Fields</a>).  The most common case of
a field boundary is the end of the prompt in the minibuffer.

        </p><p>If it is possible to move <var>count</var> words, without being stopped
prematurely by the buffer boundary or a field boundary, the value is
<code>t</code>.  Otherwise, the return value is <code>nil</code> and point stops at
the buffer boundary or field boundary.

        </p><p>If <code>inhibit-field-text-motion</code> is non-<code>nil</code>,
this function ignores field boundaries.

        <p>This variable affects the behavior of <code>forward-word</code> and

<blockquote><p>This variable affects the behavior of <code>forward-word</code> and
<code>backward-word</code>, and everything that uses them.  Its value is a
char-table (see <a href="Char_002dTables.html#Char_002dTables">Char-Tables</a>) of functions to search for word
boundaries.  If a character has a non-<code>nil</code> entry in this table,
then when a word starts or ends with that character, the corresponding
function will be called with 2 arguments: <var>pos</var> and <var>limit</var>. 
The function should return the position of the other word boundary. 
Specifically, if <var>pos</var> is smaller than <var>limit</var>, then <var>pos</var>
is at the beginning of a word, and the function should return the
position after the last character of the word; otherwise, <var>pos</var> is
at the last character of a word, and the function should return the
position of that word's first character.
