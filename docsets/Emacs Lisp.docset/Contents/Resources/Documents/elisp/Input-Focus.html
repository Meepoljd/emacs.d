<h3 class="section">29.10 Input Focus</h3>

<p><a name="index-input-focus-3181"></a><a name="index-selected-frame-3182"></a>
At any time, one frame in Emacs is the <dfn>selected frame</dfn>.  The
selected window always resides on the selected frame.

   </p><p>When Emacs displays its frames on several terminals (see <a href="Multiple-Terminals.html#Multiple-Terminals">Multiple Terminals</a>), each terminal has its own selected frame.  But only one
of these is <em>the</em> selected frame: it's the frame that belongs
to the terminal from which the most recent input came.  That is, when
Emacs runs a command that came from a certain terminal, the selected
frame is the one of that terminal.  Since Emacs runs only a single
command at any given time, it needs to consider only one selected
frame at a time; this frame is what we call <dfn>the selected frame</dfn>
in this manual.  The display on which the selected frame is shown is
the <dfn>selected frame's display</dfn>.

</p><div class="defun">
— Function: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Function/selected%2Dframe"></a><b>selected-frame</b><var><a name="index-selected_002dframe-3183"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the selected frame. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Some window systems and window managers direct keyboard input to the
window object that the mouse is in; others require explicit clicks or
commands to <dfn>shift the focus</dfn> to various window objects.  Either
way, Emacs automatically keeps track of which frame has the focus.  To
explicitly switch to a different frame from a Lisp function, call
<code>select-frame-set-input-focus</code>.

   </p><p>Lisp programs can also switch frames temporarily by calling the
function <code>select-frame</code>.  This does not alter the window system's
concept of focus; rather, it escapes from the window manager's control
until that control is somehow reasserted.

   </p><p>When using a text terminal, only one frame can be displayed at a time
on the terminal, so after a call to <code>select-frame</code>, the next
redisplay actually displays the newly selected frame.  This frame
remains selected until a subsequent call to <code>select-frame</code>.  Each
frame on a text terminal has a number which appears in the mode line
before the buffer name (see <a href="Mode-Line-Variables.html#Mode-Line-Variables">Mode Line Variables</a>).

</p><div class="defun">
— Function: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Function/select%2Dframe%2Dset%2Dinput%2Dfocus"></a><b>select-frame-set-input-focus</b><var> frame &amp;optional norecord<a name="index-select_002dframe_002dset_002dinput_002dfocus-3184"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function selects <var>frame</var>, raises it (should it happen to be
obscured by other frames) and tries to give it the X server's focus. 
On a text terminal, the next redisplay displays the new frame on the
entire terminal screen.  The optional argument <var>norecord</var> has the
same meaning as for <code>select-frame</code> (see below).  The return value
of this function is not significant. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Ideally, the function described next should focus a frame without also
raising it above other frames.  Unfortunately, many window-systems or
window managers may refuse to comply.

</p><div class="defun">
— Function: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Function/x%2Dfocus%2Dframe"></a><b>x-focus-frame</b><var> frame &amp;optional noactivate<a name="index-x_002dfocus_002dframe-3185"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function gives <var>frame</var> the focus of the X server without
necessarily raising it.  <var>frame</var> <code>nil</code> means use the selected
frame.  Under X, the optional argument <var>noactivate</var>, if
non-<code>nil</code>, means to avoid making <var>frame</var>'s window-system window
the “active” window which should insist a bit more on avoiding to
raise <var>frame</var> above other frames.

        </p><p>On MS-Windows the <var>noactivate</var> argument has no effect.  However, if
<var>frame</var> is a child frame (see <a href="Child-Frames.html#Child-Frames">Child Frames</a>), this function
usually focuses <var>frame</var> without raising it above other child
frames.

        </p><p>If there is no window system support, this function does nothing. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
— Command: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/select%2Dframe"></a><b>select-frame</b><var> frame &amp;optional norecord<a name="index-select_002dframe-3186"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function selects frame <var>frame</var>, temporarily disregarding the
focus of the X server if any.  The selection of <var>frame</var> lasts until
the next time the user does something to select a different frame, or
until the next time this function is called.  (If you are using a
window system, the previously selected frame may be restored as the
selected frame after return to the command loop, because it still may
have the window system's input focus.)

        </p><p>The specified <var>frame</var> becomes the selected frame, and its terminal
becomes the selected terminal.  This function then calls
<code>select-window</code> as a subroutine, passing the window selected
within <var>frame</var> as its first argument and <var>norecord</var> as its
second argument (hence, if <var>norecord</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, this
avoids changing the order of recently selected windows and the buffer
list).  See <a href="Selecting-Windows.html#Selecting-Windows">Selecting Windows</a>.

        </p><p>This function returns <var>frame</var>, or <code>nil</code> if <var>frame</var> has
been deleted.

        </p><p>In general, you should never use <code>select-frame</code> in a way that
could switch to a different terminal without switching back when
you're done. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Emacs cooperates with the window system by arranging to select frames as
the server and window manager request.  It does so by generating a
special kind of input event, called a <dfn>focus</dfn> event, when
appropriate.  The command loop handles a focus event by calling
<code>handle-switch-frame</code>.  See <a href="Focus-Events.html#Focus-Events">Focus Events</a>.

</p><div class="defun">
— Command: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/handle%2Dswitch%2Dframe"></a><b>handle-switch-frame</b><var> frame<a name="index-handle_002dswitch_002dframe-3187"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function handles a focus event by selecting frame <var>frame</var>.

        </p><p>Focus events normally do their job by invoking this command. 
Don't call it for any other reason. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
— Function: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Function/redirect%2Dframe%2Dfocus"></a><b>redirect-frame-focus</b><var> frame &amp;optional focus-frame<a name="index-redirect_002dframe_002dfocus-3188"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function redirects focus from <var>frame</var> to <var>focus-frame</var>. 
This means that <var>focus-frame</var> will receive subsequent keystrokes and
events intended for <var>frame</var>.  After such an event, the value of
<code>last-event-frame</code> will be <var>focus-frame</var>.  Also, switch-frame
events specifying <var>frame</var> will instead select <var>focus-frame</var>.

        </p><p>If <var>focus-frame</var> is omitted or <code>nil</code>, that cancels any existing
redirection for <var>frame</var>, which therefore once again receives its own
events.

        </p><p>One use of focus redirection is for frames that don't have minibuffers. 
These frames use minibuffers on other frames.  Activating a minibuffer
on another frame redirects focus to that frame.  This puts the focus on
the minibuffer's frame, where it belongs, even though the mouse remains
in the frame that activated the minibuffer.

        </p><p>Selecting a frame can also change focus redirections.  Selecting frame
<code>bar</code>, when <code>foo</code> had been selected, changes any redirections
pointing to <code>foo</code> so that they point to <code>bar</code> instead.  This
allows focus redirection to work properly when the user switches from
one frame to another using <code>select-window</code>.

        </p><p>This means that a frame whose focus is redirected to itself is treated
differently from a frame whose focus is not redirected. 
<code>select-frame</code> affects the former but not the latter.

        </p><p>The redirection lasts until <code>redirect-frame-focus</code> is called to
change it.

<blockquote><p>This option informs Emacs whether and how the window manager transfers
focus when you move the mouse pointer into a frame.  It can have three
meaningful values:

          </p><dl>
<dt><code>nil</code></dt><dd>The default value <code>nil</code> should be used when your window manager
follows a “click-to-focus” policy where you have to click the mouse
inside of a frame in order for that frame to gain focus.

          <br></dd><dt><code>t</code></dt><dd>The value <code>t</code> should be used when your window manager has the focus
automatically follow the position of the mouse pointer but a frame that
gains focus is not raised automatically and may even remain occluded by
other window-system windows.

          <br></dd><dt><code>auto-raise</code></dt><dd>The value <code>auto-raise</code> should be used when your window manager has
the focus automatically follow the position of the mouse pointer and a
frame that gains focus is raised automatically. 
</dd></dl>

        <p>If this option is non-<code>nil</code>, Emacs moves the mouse pointer to the
frame selected by <code>select-frame-set-input-focus</code>.  That function is
used by a number of commands like, for example, <code>other-frame</code> and
<code>pop-to-buffer</code>.

        </p><p>The distinction between the values <code>t</code> and <code>auto-raise</code> is not
needed for “normal” frames because the window manager usually takes
care of raising them.  It is useful to automatically raise child frames
via <code>mouse-autoselect-window</code> (see <a href="Mouse-Window-Auto_002dselection.html#Mouse-Window-Auto_002dselection">Mouse Window Auto-selection</a>).

        </p><p>Note that this option does not distinguish “sloppy” focus (where the
frame that previously had focus retains focus as long as the mouse
pointer does not move into another window manager window) from
“strict” focus (where a frame immediately loses focus when it's left
by the mouse pointer).  Neither does it recognize whether your window
manager supports delayed focusing or auto-raising where you can
explicitly specify the time until a new frame gets focus or is
auto-raised.

        </p><p>You can supply a “focus follows mouse” policy for individual Emacs
windows by customizing the variable <code>mouse-autoselect-window</code>
(see <a href="Mouse-Window-Auto_002dselection.html#Mouse-Window-Auto_002dselection">Mouse Window Auto-selection</a>).
