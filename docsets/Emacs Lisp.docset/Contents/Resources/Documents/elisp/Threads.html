<h2 class="chapter">37 Threads</h2>

<p><a name="index-threads-4231"></a><a name="index-concurrency-4232"></a>
  Emacs Lisp provides a limited form of concurrency, called
<dfn>threads</dfn>.  All the threads in a given instance of Emacs share the
same memory.  Concurrency in Emacs Lisp is &ldquo;mostly cooperative&rdquo;,
meaning that Emacs will only switch execution between threads at
well-defined times.  However, the Emacs thread support has been
designed in a way to later allow more fine-grained concurrency, and
correct programs should not rely on cooperative threading.

   <p>Currently, thread switching will occur upon explicit request via
<code>thread-yield</code>, when waiting for keyboard input or for process
output (e.g., during <code>accept-process-output</code>), or during blocking
operations relating to threads, such as mutex locking or
<code>thread-join</code>.

   <p>Emacs Lisp provides primitives to create and control threads, and
also to create and control mutexes and condition variables, useful for
thread synchronization.

   <p>While global variables are shared among all Emacs Lisp threads,
local variables are not&mdash;a dynamic <code>let</code> binding is local.  Each
thread also has its own current buffer (see <a href="Current-Buffer.html#Current-Buffer">Current Buffer</a>) and
its own match data (see <a href="Match-Data.html#Match-Data">Match Data</a>).

   <p>Note that <code>let</code> bindings are treated specially by the Emacs
Lisp implementation.  There is no way to duplicate this unwinding and
rewinding behavior other than by using <code>let</code>.  For example, a
manual implementation of <code>let</code> written using
<code>unwind-protect</code> cannot arrange for variable values to be
thread-specific.

   <p>In the case of lexical bindings (see <a href="Variable-Scoping.html#Variable-Scoping">Variable Scoping</a>), a
closure is an object like any other in Emacs Lisp, and bindings in a
closure are shared by any threads invoking the closure.
