<h3 class="section">28.30 Hooks for Window Scrolling and Changes</h3>

<p><a name="index-hooks-for-window-operations-2902"></a>
This section describes how a Lisp program can take action whenever a
window displays a different part of its buffer or a different buffer. 
There are three actions that can change this: scrolling the window,
switching buffers in the window, and changing the size of the window. 
The first two actions run <code>window-scroll-functions</code>; the last runs
<code>window-size-change-functions</code>.

</p><div class="defun">
— Variable: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/window%2Dscroll%2Dfunctions"></a><b>window-scroll-functions</b><var><a name="index-window_002dscroll_002dfunctions-2903"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable holds a list of functions that Emacs should call before
redisplaying a window with scrolling.  Displaying a different buffer in
the window also runs these functions.

        </p><p>This variable is not a normal hook, because each function is called with
two arguments: the window, and its new display-start position.  At the
time of the call, the display-start position of the window argument is
already set to its new value, and the buffer to be displayed in the
window is already set as the current buffer.

        </p><p>These functions must take care when using <code>window-end</code>
(see <a href="Window-Start-and-End.html#Window-Start-and-End">Window Start and End</a>); if you need an up-to-date value, you
must use the <var>update</var> argument to ensure you get it.

        </p><p><strong>Warning:</strong> don't use this feature to alter the way the window
is scrolled.  It's not designed for that, and such use probably won't
work. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
— Function: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Function/run%2Dwindow%2Dscroll%2Dfunctions"></a><b>run-window-scroll-functions</b><var> &amp;optional window<a name="index-run_002dwindow_002dscroll_002dfunctions-2904"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function calls <code>window-scroll-functions</code> for the specified
<var>window</var>, which defaults to the selected window. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
— Variable: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/window%2Dsize%2Dchange%2Dfunctions"></a><b>window-size-change-functions</b><var><a name="index-window_002dsize_002dchange_002dfunctions-2905"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This variable holds a list of functions to be called if the size of any
window changes for any reason.  The functions are called once per
redisplay, and once for each frame on which size changes have occurred.

        </p><p>Each function receives the frame as its sole argument.  To find out
whether a specific window has changed size, compare the return values of
<code>window-pixel-width-before-size-change</code> and
<code>window-pixel-width</code> respectively
<code>window-pixel-height-before-size-change</code> and
<code>window-pixel-height</code> for that window (see <a href="Window-Sizes.html#Window-Sizes">Window Sizes</a>).

        </p><p>These function are usually only called when at least one window was
added or has changed size since the last time this hook was run for the
associated frame.  In some rare cases this hook also runs when a window
that was added intermittently has been deleted afterwards.  In these
cases none of the windows on the frame will appear to have changed its
size.

        </p><p>You may use <code>save-selected-window</code> in these functions
(see <a href="Selecting-Windows.html#Selecting-Windows">Selecting Windows</a>).  However, do not use
<code>save-window-excursion</code> (see <a href="Window-Configurations.html#Window-Configurations">Window Configurations</a>); exiting
that macro counts as a size change, which would cause these functions to
be called again. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
— Variable: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/window%2Dconfiguration%2Dchange%2Dhook"></a><b>window-configuration-change-hook</b><var><a name="index-window_002dconfiguration_002dchange_002dhook-2906"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A normal hook that is run every time the window configuration of a frame
changes.  Window configuration changes include splitting and deleting
windows, and the display of a different buffer in a window.  Resizing the
frame or individual windows do not count as configuration changes.  Use
<code>window-size-change-functions</code>, see above, when you want to track
size changes that are not caused by the deletion or creation of windows.

        </p><p>The buffer-local value of this hook is run once for each window on the
affected frame, with the relevant window selected and its buffer
current.  The global value of this hook is run once for the modified
frame, with that frame selected. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
— Function: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Function/run%2Dwindow%2Dconfiguration%2Dchange%2Dhook"></a><b>run-window-configuration-change-hook</b><var> &amp;optional frame<a name="index-run_002dwindow_002dconfiguration_002dchange_002dhook-2907"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function runs <code>window-configuration-change-hook</code> for the
specified <var>frame</var>, which defaults to the selected frame. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>In addition, you can use <code>jit-lock-register</code> to register a Font
Lock fontification function, which will be called whenever parts of a
buffer are (re)fontified because a window was scrolled or its size
changed.  See <a href="Other-Font-Lock-Variables.html#Other-Font-Lock-Variables">Other Font Lock Variables</a>.
