<h2 class="appendix">Appendix A Emacs 25 Antinews</h2>

<!-- Update the elisp.texi Antinews menu entry with the above version number. -->
<p>For those users who live backwards in time, here is information about
downgrading to Emacs version 25.3.  We hope you will enjoy the greater
simplicity that results from the absence of many Emacs&nbsp;26.1<!-- /@w --> features.

<h3 class="section">A.1 Old Lisp Features in Emacs 25</h3>

     <ul>
<li>The concurrency features have been removed.  Even in its limited
&ldquo;mostly cooperative&rdquo; form, with only one Lisp thread running at any
given time, it made Emacs significantly more complex for Lisp programs
that need to work correctly in the presence of additional threads.

     <li>Handling of file attributes has been simplified by discarding the
accessor functions, such as <code>file-attribute-type</code> and
<code>file-attribute-modification-time</code>.  Real Lisp programmers always
access the individual attributes by their ordinal numbers, and can
recite those numbers in their sleep.

     <li>The networking code is back at its pristine simplicity, as we deleted
the use of asynchronous DNS resolution, connection, and TLS
negotiation for TLS streams.  You no longer need to consider the
resulting complexity and interesting race conditions when you write
Lisp programs that use network communications.  As a direct
consequence, the <code>:complete-negotiation</code> parameter of
<code>gnutls-boot</code> has become unnecessary, and was removed&mdash;just one
example of how removal of asynchronicity simplifies Emacs.

     <li>We've removed the <samp><span class="file">puny.el</span></samp> library, so Web sites with
non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> URLs are no longer easily accessible.  But such
sites become more and more rare as you move back in time, so having a
specialized library for their support was deemed an unnecessary
maintenance burden.

     <li>The time conversion functions <code>current-time-string</code>,
<code>current-time-zone</code>, <code>decode-time</code>,
<code>format-time-string</code>, and <code>set-time-zone-rule</code> no longer
accept integer offsets as time zone rules, to make it more of a
challenge to convert foreign timestamps.  Also,
<code>format-time-string</code> no longer converts &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%q</span></samp>&rsquo; to the calendar
quarter, as that is something you can easily do for yourself.

     <li>Field numbers like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%2$</span></samp>&rsquo; in format specifiers are no longer
available.  We decided that their use makes code reading and
comprehension much harder, and that having them is unjustified in the
past where similar features in popular C libraries will also be gone.

     <li>Since the built-in capability to display line numbers has been removed
(see <a href="../emacs/Antinews.html#Antinews">Antinews</a>), we've also deleted
the <code>line-number-display-width</code> function and the support for the
<code>display-line-numbers-disable</code> property, as Lisp programs that do
their own display layout decisions no longer need to cater to this
tricky feature.

     <li>Regular expressions have been simplified by removing support for
Unicode character properties in the <code>[:blank:]</code> regexp class.  As
result, this class will match only spaces and tabs.  Once again, this
is in line with diminishing importance of Unicode as you move back in
time.

     <li>For similar reasons, we removed the function <code>char-from-name</code>. 
It should be easy enough to access the full list of Unicode characters
returned by <code>ucs-names</code> instead, for as long as Unicode support
in Emacs exists (which shouldn't be too long).

     <li>Various functions that accept file names as arguments, such as
<code>file-attributes</code>, <code>file-symlink-p</code>, and
<code>make-symbolic-link</code> gained back the special support for file
names quoted with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/:</span></samp>&rsquo;, and they now interpret &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>&rsquo; in
symlink targets as you'd expect: to mean your home directory.  The
confusing differences between the operation of these functions in
interactive and non-interactive invocations has been removed.

     <li>Several functions that create or rename their files now treat their
destination specially if it happens to be a directory, even when its
name does not appear to be that of a directory.  For example,
<code>(rename-file "A" "B")</code> no longer renames <samp><span class="file">A</span></samp> to <samp><span class="file">B</span></samp> if
<samp><span class="file">B</span></samp> happens to be a directory.  This is so that dealing with
files becomes more of an adventure.

     <li>The <code>format</code> function now returns new strings in more cases, to
place more stress on the Emacs memory manager and thereby test Emacs
better.

     <li>The function <samp><span class="file">assoc</span></samp> has been simplified by removing its third
optional argument.  It now always uses <code>equal</code> for comparison. 
Likewise, <code>alist-get</code> always uses <code>assq</code>, and <code>map-get</code>
and <code>map-put</code> always use <code>eql</code> for their comparisons.

     <li>Numeric comparisons and the functions <code>format</code>,
<code>make-hash-table</code>, <code>min</code>, <code>max</code> and <code>logb</code> now
occasionally round values internally to make their results less
predictable.

     <li>The functions <code>ffloor</code>, <code>fceiling</code>l, <code>ftruncate</code> and
<code>fround</code> now accept integer arguments.  Conversely, functions
like <code>decode-char</code> that accept floating-point integers now accept
arguments that are not integers.  In both cases the results are
amusingly nonsensical sometimes.

     <li>GnuTLS cryptographic functions are no longer available in Emacs.  We
have decided that the needs for such functionality are deteriorating,
and their cumbersome interfaces make them hard to use.

     <li>We have removed support for records of user-defined types, and
<code>cl-defstruct</code> no longer uses records.  This removes the
potential for quite a few places where existing and past code could be
broken by records.

     <li>You can again use <code>string-as-unibyte</code>,
<code>string-make-multibyte</code>, and other similar functions, without
being annoyed by messages about their deprecation.  This is in
preparation for removal of multibyte text from Emacs in the distant
past.

     <li>The <code>string-version-lessp</code> function has been removed, to
encourage programmers to use their own idiosyncratic methods to
determine whether one version string precedes another.

     <li>The function <code>read-color</code> no longer displays color names using
each color as the background.  We have determined that this surprises
users and produces funny inconsistent results on color-challenged
terminals.

     <li>Support for 24-bit color on text terminals has been dropped, since
it wasn't needed long ago.

     <li>We removed the function <code>file-name-case-insensitive-p</code>, as
testing for the OS symbol should be enough for the observable past to
come, and learning to use yet another API is a burden.

     <li>The function <code>read-multiple-choice</code> is also gone, in recognition
of the fact that nothing makes Emacs Lisp hackers rejoice more than
the need to sit down and write yet another interactive
question-and-answer function, and make it optimal for each specific
case.

     <li>The function <code>add-variable-watcher</code> and the corresponding
debugger command <code>debug-on-variable-change</code> have been removed. 
They make debugging more complicated, while examining the value of a
variable at each stop point is easy enough to cover the same use
cases.  Let simplicity rule!

     <li>The function <code>mapcan</code> is gone; use <code>mapcar</code> instead, and
process the resulting list as you see fit.

     <li>Low-level list functions like <code>length</code> and <code>member</code> can now
loop indefinitely when given cyclic lists, causing Emacs to freeze. 
This can help these functions run a tiny bit faster in the usual case
where the input is not cyclic.

     <li>The <code>write-region</code> function no longer propagates its
<var>lockname</var> argument to file name handlers.

     <li>You can once again write a Lisp program that returns funny random
values from <code>file-attributes</code> by having another process alter the
filesystem while Emacs is accessing the file.  This can give rise to
some interesting applications in the near past.

     <li>The functions <code>file-attributes</code>, <code>file-symlink-p</code>, and
<code>make-symbolic-link</code> now quietly mutate the target of a local
symbolic link in some cases, to make it more of a challenge to deal
with arbitrary symlinks in Emacs code.

     <li>The error <code>file-missing</code> has been removed; operations now lump
such errors into the <code>file-error</code> category instead.

     <li>The function <code>delete-directory</code> now signals an error if operating
recursively and some other process deletes the directory before this
function gets to it.

     <li>The <code>dutch</code> input method now attempts to support Turkish too,
albeit incorrectly.  Also, it converts &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">IJ</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ij</span></samp>&rsquo; to
special characters instead of leaving them alone.

     <li>Non-breaking hyphens and approximations to quotes are now displayed
just with the <code>escape-glyph</code> face instead of having faces of
their own.  This is simpler and gives the user amusing puzzles to
solve when viewing text containing these characters.

     <li>The user option <code>electric-quote-context-sensitive</code> and the
variable <code>electric-quote-inhibit-functions</code>, so that electric
quoting is simpler and more likely to do the wrong thing.

     <li>The user option <code>text-quoting-style</code> has been removed, and is now
just a variable.

     <li>We have removed the functions <code>file-name-quote</code>,
<code>file-name-unquote</code>, and <code>file-name-quoted-p</code>.  Writing code
that checks whether a file name is already quoted is easy, and doubly
quoting a file name should not produce any problems for well-written
Lisp code.

     <li>Frame parameters like <code>z-group</code>, <code>min-width</code>,
<code>parent-frame</code>, <code>delete-before</code>, etc. have been removed. 
Emacs should not replace your window-manager, certainly not as
window-managers become less and less capable.

     <li>We decided that the format of mode line and header line should be
customizable only based on buffers; the <code>mode-line-format</code> and
<code>header-line-format</code> window parameters have been removed.

     <li>Emacs now normally builds a limited <samp><span class="command">movemail</span></samp> substitute that
retrieves POP3 email only via insecure channels, and the
configure-time option <samp><span class="option">--with-mailutils</span></samp> has been removed. 
This simplifies Emacs setup when security is not important.

     <li>The configure-time option <samp><span class="option">--enable-gcc-warnings=warn-only</span></samp>
has been removed, so that build-time warnings are always fatal now.

     <li>The configure-time option <samp><span class="option">--disable-build-details</span></samp> has been
removed.  This way, Emacs builds are unique and irreproducible.

     <li>The variable <code>emacs-version</code> now includes the build number
instead of storing it separately in <code>emacs-build-number</code>.

     <li>Emacs has been ported to IRIX.

     <li>Several options and variables have been removed to simplify Emacs and
potentially make it less reliable.  These include the
<samp><span class="option">--module-assertions</span></samp> option, the
<code>attempt-stack-overflow-recovery</code> variable, and the
<code>attempt-orderly-shutdown-on-fatal-signal</code> variable.

     <li>As part of the ongoing quest for simplicity, many other functions and
variables have been eliminated. 
</ul>
