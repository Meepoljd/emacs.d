<h3 class="section">12.9 Running a function when a variable is changed.</h3>

<p><a name="index-variable-watchpoints-797"></a><a name="index-watchpoints-for-Lisp-variables-798"></a>
It is sometimes useful to take some action when a variable changes its
value.  The watchpoint facility provides the means to do so.  Some
possible uses for this feature include keeping display in sync with
variable settings, and invoking the debugger to track down unexpected
changes to variables (see <a href="Variable-Debugging.html#Variable-Debugging">Variable Debugging</a>).

   </p><p>The following functions may be used to manipulate and query the watch
functions for a variable.

</p><div class="defun">
— Function: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Function/add%2Dvariable%2Dwatcher"></a><b>add-variable-watcher</b><var> symbol watch-function<a name="index-add_002dvariable_002dwatcher-799"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function arranges for <var>watch-function</var> to be called whenever
<var>symbol</var> is modified.  Modifications through aliases
(see <a href="Variable-Aliases.html#Variable-Aliases">Variable Aliases</a>) will have the same effect.

        </p><p><var>watch-function</var> will be called with 4 arguments: (<var>symbol</var>
<var>newval</var> <var>operation</var> <var>where</var>).

        </p><p><var>symbol</var> is the variable being changed. 
<var>newval</var> is the value it will be changed to. 
<var>operation</var> is a symbol representing the kind of change, one of:
`set', `let', `unlet', `makunbound', and `defvaralias'. 
<var>where</var> is a buffer if the buffer-local value of the variable is
being changed, <code>nil</code> otherwise. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
— Function: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Function/remove%2Dvariable%2Dwatch"></a><b>remove-variable-watch</b><var> symbol watch-function<a name="index-remove_002dvariable_002dwatch-800"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function removes <var>watch-function</var> from <var>symbol</var>'s list of
watchers. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
— Function: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Function/get%2Dvariable%2Dwatchers"></a><b>get-variable-watchers</b><var> symbol<a name="index-get_002dvariable_002dwatchers-801"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the list of <var>symbol</var>'s active watcher
functions. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<h4 class="subsection">12.9.1 Limitations</h4>

<p>There are a couple of ways in which a variable could be modified (or at
least appear to be modified) without triggering a watchpoint.

   </p><p>Since watchpoints are attached to symbols, modification to the
objects contained within variables (e.g., by a list modification
function see <a href="Modifying-Lists.html#Modifying-Lists">Modifying Lists</a>) is not caught by this mechanism.

   </p><p>Additionally, C code can modify the value of variables directly,
bypassing the watchpoint mechanism.

   </p><p>A minor limitation of this feature, again because it targets symbols,
is that only variables of dynamic scope may be watched.  This poses
little difficulty, since modifications to lexical variables can be
discovered easily by inspecting the code within the scope of the
variable (unlike dynamic variables, which can be modified by any code
at all, see <a href="Variable-Scoping.html#Variable-Scoping">Variable Scoping</a>).
