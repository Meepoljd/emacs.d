<h4 class="subsection">2.3.17 Record Type</h4>

<p>A <dfn>record</dfn> is much like a <code>vector</code>.  However, the first
element is used to hold its type as returned by <code>type-of</code>.  The
purpose of records is to allow programmers to create objects with new
types that are not built into Emacs.

   <p>See <a href="Records.html#Records">Records</a>, for functions that work with records.
