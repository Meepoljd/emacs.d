<h3 class="section">34.4 Regular Expression Searching</h3>

<p><a name="index-regular-expression-searching-4056"></a><a name="index-regexp-searching-4057"></a><a name="index-searching-for-regexp-4058"></a>
  In GNU Emacs, you can search for the next match for a regular
expression (see <a href="Syntax-of-Regexps.html#Syntax-of-Regexps">Syntax of Regexps</a>) either incrementally or not. 
For incremental search commands, see <a href="../emacs/Regexp-Search.html#Regexp-Search">Regular Expression Search</a>.  Here we describe
only the search functions useful in programs.  The principal one is
<code>re-search-forward</code>.

   </p><p>These search functions convert the regular expression to multibyte if
the buffer is multibyte; they convert the regular expression to unibyte
if the buffer is unibyte.  See <a href="Text-Representations.html#Text-Representations">Text Representations</a>.

</p><div class="defun">
— Command: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/re%2Dsearch%2Dforward"></a><b>re-search-forward</b><var> regexp &amp;optional limit noerror count<a name="index-re_002dsearch_002dforward-4059"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function searches forward in the current buffer for a string of
text that is matched by the regular expression <var>regexp</var>.  The
function skips over any amount of text that is not matched by
<var>regexp</var>, and leaves point at the end of the first match found. 
It returns the new value of point.

        </p><p>If <var>limit</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it must be a position in the current
buffer.  It specifies the upper bound to the search.  No match
extending after that position is accepted.  If <var>limit</var> is omitted
or <code>nil</code>, it defaults to the end of the accessible portion of the
buffer.

        </p><p>What <code>re-search-forward</code> does when the search fails depends on
the value of <var>noerror</var>:

          </p><dl>
<dt><code>nil</code></dt><dd>Signal a <code>search-failed</code> error. 
<br></dd><dt><code>t</code></dt><dd>Do nothing and return <code>nil</code>. 
<br></dd><dt>anything else</dt><dd>Move point to <var>limit</var> (or the end of the accessible portion of the
buffer) and return <code>nil</code>. 
</dd></dl>

        <p>The argument <var>noerror</var> only affects valid searches which fail to
find a match.  Invalid arguments cause errors regardless of
<var>noerror</var>.

        </p><p>If <var>count</var> is a positive number <var>n</var>, the search is done
<var>n</var> times; each successive search starts at the end of the
previous match.  If all these successive searches succeed, the
function call succeeds, moving point and returning its new value. 
Otherwise the function call fails, with results depending on the value
of <var>noerror</var>, as described above.  If <var>count</var> is a negative
number -<var>n</var>, the search is done <var>n</var> times in the opposite
(backward) direction.

        </p><p>In the following example, point is initially before the ‘<samp><span class="samp">T</span></samp>’. 
Evaluating the search call moves point to the end of that line (between
the ‘<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>’ of ‘<samp><span class="samp">hat</span></samp>’ and the newline).

     </p><pre class="example">          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          I read "-!-The cat in the hat
          comes back" twice.
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          
          (re-search-forward "[a-z]+" nil t 5)
               ⇒ 27
          
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          I read "The cat in the hat-!-
          comes back" twice.
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------

<blockquote><p>This function searches backward in the current buffer for a string of
text that is matched by the regular expression <var>regexp</var>, leaving
point at the beginning of the first text found.

        </p><p>This function is analogous to <code>re-search-forward</code>, but they are not
simple mirror images.  <code>re-search-forward</code> finds the match whose
beginning is as close as possible to the starting point.  If
<code>re-search-backward</code> were a perfect mirror image, it would find the
match whose end is as close as possible.  However, in fact it finds the
match whose beginning is as close as possible (and yet ends before the
starting point).  The reason for this is that matching a regular
expression at a given spot always works from beginning to end, and
starts at a specified beginning position.

        </p><p>A true mirror-image of <code>re-search-forward</code> would require a special
feature for matching regular expressions from end to beginning.  It's
not worth the trouble of implementing that.

<blockquote><p>This function returns the index of the start of the first match for
the regular expression <var>regexp</var> in <var>string</var>, or <code>nil</code> if
there is no match.  If <var>start</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, the search starts

<blockquote><p>This function determines whether the text in the current buffer directly
following point matches the regular expression <var>regexp</var>.  “Directly
following” means precisely that: the search is “anchored” and it can
succeed only starting with the first character following point.  The
result is <code>t</code> if so, <code>nil</code> otherwise.

        </p><p>This function does not move point, but it does update the match data. 
See <a href="Match-Data.html#Match-Data">Match Data</a>.  If you need to test for a match without modifying
the match data, use <code>looking-at-p</code>, described below.

        </p><p>In this example, point is located directly before the ‘<samp><span class="samp">T</span></samp>’.  If it
were anywhere else, the result would be <code>nil</code>.

<blockquote><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if <var>regexp</var> matches the text
immediately before point (i.e., ending at point), and <code>nil</code> otherwise.

        </p><p>Because regular expression matching works only going forward, this is
implemented by searching backwards from point for a match that ends at
point.  That can be quite slow if it has to search a long distance. 
You can bound the time required by specifying a non-<code>nil</code> value
for <var>limit</var>, which says not to search before <var>limit</var>.  In this
case, the match that is found must begin at or after <var>limit</var>. 
Here's an example:

     </p><pre class="example">          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          I read "-!-The cat in the hat
          comes back" twice.
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          
          (looking-back "read \"" 3)
               ⇒ t
          (looking-back "read \"" 4)
               ⇒ nil
</pre>
        <p>If <var>greedy</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, this function extends the match
backwards as far as possible, stopping when a single additional
previous character cannot be part of a match for <var>regexp</var>.  When
the match is extended, its starting position is allowed to occur
before <var>limit</var>.

     <!-- https://debbugs.gnu.org/5689 -->
        </p><p>As a general recommendation, try to avoid using <code>looking-back</code>
wherever possible, since it is slow.  For this reason, there are no
plans to add a <code>looking-back-p</code> function.

spaces in a regular expression being searched for stands for use of

‘<samp><span class="samp">[...]</span></samp>’ and ‘<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>’, ‘<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>’, ‘<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>’ are not affected by
