<h3 class="section">24.4 Text Quoting Style</h3>

<p>Typically, grave accents and apostrophes are treated specially in
documentation strings and diagnostic messages, and translate to matching
single quotation marks (also called “curved quotes”).  For example,
the documentation string <tt>"Alias for `foo'."</tt> and the function call
<code>(message "Alias for `foo'.")</code> both translate to <tt>"Alias for
‘foo’."</tt>.  Less commonly, Emacs displays grave accents and apostrophes
as themselves, or as apostrophes only (e.g., <tt>"Alias for 'foo'."</tt>). 
Documentation strings and message formats should be written so that
they display well with any of these styles.  For example, the
documentation string <tt>"Alias for 'foo'."</tt> is probably not what you
want, as it can display as <tt>"Alias for ’foo’."</tt>, an unusual style in
English.

   </p><p>Sometimes you may need to display a grave accent or apostrophe
without translation, regardless of text quoting style.  In a
documentation string, you can do this with escapes.  For example, in
the documentation string <tt>"\\=`(a ,(sin 0)) ==&gt; (a 0.0)"</tt> the grave
accent is intended to denote Lisp code, so it is escaped and displays
as itself regardless of quoting style.  In a call to <code>message</code> or
<code>error</code>, you can avoid translation by using a format <tt>"%s"</tt>
with an argument that is a call to <code>format</code>.  For example,
<code>(message "%s" (format "`(a ,(sin %S)) ==&gt; (a %S)" x (sin x)))</code>
displays a message that starts with grave accent regardless of text
quoting style.

<blockquote><p><a name="index-curved-quotes-2161"></a><a name="index-curly-quotes-2162"></a>The value of this user option is a symbol that specifies the style
Emacs should use for single quotes in the wording of help and
messages.  If the option's value is <code>curve</code>, the style is
<tt>‘like this’</tt> with curved single quotes.  If the value is
<code>straight</code>, the style is <tt>'like this'</tt> with straight
apostrophes.  If the value is <code>grave</code>, quotes are not translated
and the style is <tt>`like this'</tt> with grave accent and apostrophe, the
standard style before Emacs version 25.  The default value <code>nil</code>
acts like <code>curve</code> if curved single quotes seem to be displayable,
and like <code>grave</code> otherwise.

        </p><p>This option is useful on platforms that have problems with curved
quotes.  You can customize it freely according to your personal
preference.
