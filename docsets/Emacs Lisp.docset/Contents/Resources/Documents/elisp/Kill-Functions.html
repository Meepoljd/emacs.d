<h4 class="subsection">32.8.2 Functions for Killing</h4>

<p><code>kill-region</code> is the usual subroutine for killing text.  Any
command that calls this function is a kill command (and should
probably have ‘<samp><span class="samp">kill</span></samp>’ in its name).  <code>kill-region</code> puts the
newly killed text in a new element at the beginning of the kill ring or
adds it to the most recent element.  It determines automatically (using
<code>last-command</code>) whether the previous command was a kill command,
and if so appends the killed text to the most recent entry.

   </p><p><a name="index-filtering-killed-text-3501"></a>  The commands described below can filter the killed text before they
save it in the kill ring.  They call <code>filter-buffer-substring</code>
(see <a href="Buffer-Contents.html#Buffer-Contents">Buffer Contents</a>) to perform the filtering.  By default,
there's no filtering, but major and minor modes and hook functions can
set up filtering, so that text saved in the kill ring is different
from what was in the buffer.

<blockquote><p>This function kills the stretch of text between <var>start</var> and
<var>end</var>; but if the optional argument <var>region</var> is
non-<code>nil</code>, it ignores <var>start</var> and <var>end</var>, and kills the
text in the current region instead.  The text is deleted but saved in
the kill ring, along with its text properties.  The value is always
<code>nil</code>.

        </p><p>In an interactive call, <var>start</var> and <var>end</var> are point and
the mark, and <var>region</var> is always non-<code>nil</code>, so the command
always kills the text in the current region.

        </p><p>If the buffer or text is read-only, <code>kill-region</code> modifies the kill
ring just the same, then signals an error without modifying the buffer. 
This is convenient because it lets the user use a series of kill
commands to copy text from a read-only buffer into the kill ring.
