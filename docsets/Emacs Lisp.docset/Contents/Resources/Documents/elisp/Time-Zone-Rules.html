<h3 class="section">40.6 Time Zone Rules</h3>

<p><a name="index-time-zone-rules-5092"></a>
<a name="index-TZ_0040r_007b_002c-environment-variable_007d-5093"></a>The default time zone is determined by the <samp><span class="env">TZ</span></samp> environment
variable.  See <a href="System-Environment.html#System-Environment">System Environment</a>.  For example, you can tell Emacs
to default to Universal Time with <code>(setenv "TZ" "UTC0")</code>.  If
<samp><span class="env">TZ</span></samp> is not in the environment, Emacs uses system wall clock time,
which is a platform-dependent default time zone.

   </p><p>The set of supported <samp><span class="env">TZ</span></samp> strings is system-dependent.  GNU and
many other systems support the tzdata database, e.g.,
‘<samp><span class="samp">"America/New_York"</span></samp>’ specifies the time zone and daylight saving
time history for locations near New York City.  GNU and most other
systems support POSIX-style <samp><span class="env">TZ</span></samp> strings, e.g.,
‘<samp><span class="samp">"EST+5EDT,M4.1.0/2,M10.5.0/2"</span></samp>’ specifies the rules used in New
York from 1987 through 2006.  All systems support the string
‘<samp><span class="samp">"UTC0"</span></samp>’ meaning Universal Time.

   </p><p><a name="index-time-zone-rule-5094"></a>Functions that convert to and from local time accept an optional
<dfn>time zone rule</dfn> argument, which specifies the conversion's time
zone and daylight saving time history.  If the time zone rule is
omitted or <code>nil</code>, the conversion uses Emacs's default time zone. 
If it is <code>t</code>, the conversion uses Universal Time.  If it is
<code>wall</code>, the conversion uses the system wall clock time.  If it is
a string, the conversion uses the time zone rule equivalent to setting
<samp><span class="env">TZ</span></samp> to that string.  If it is a list (<var>offset</var> <var>abbr</var>), where
<var>offset</var> is an integer number of seconds east of Universal Time
and <var>abbr</var> is a string, the conversion uses a fixed time zone with
the given offset and abbreviation.  An integer <var>offset</var> is treated
as if it were (<var>offset</var> <var>abbr</var>), where <var>abbr</var> is a numeric
abbreviation on POSIX-compatible platforms and is unspecified on
MS-Windows.

</p><div class="defun">
— Function: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Function/current%2Dtime%2Dzone"></a><b>current-time-zone</b><var> &amp;optional time zone<a name="index-current_002dtime_002dzone-5095"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-time-zone_002c-current-5096"></a>This function returns a list describing the time zone that the user is
in.

        </p><p>The value has the form <code>(</code><var>offset</var> <var>abbr</var><code>)</code>.  Here
<var>offset</var> is an integer giving the number of seconds ahead of Universal Time
(east of Greenwich).  A negative value means west of Greenwich.  The
second element, <var>abbr</var>, is a string giving an abbreviation for the
time zone, e.g., ‘<samp><span class="samp">"CST"</span></samp>’ for China Standard Time or for
U.S. Central Standard Time.  Both elements can change when daylight
saving time begins or ends; if the user has specified a time zone that
does not use a seasonal time adjustment, then the value is constant
through time.

        </p><p>If the operating system doesn't supply all the information necessary to
compute the value, the unknown elements of the list are <code>nil</code>.

        </p><p>The argument <var>time</var>, if given, specifies a time value to
analyze instead of the current time.  The optional argument <var>zone</var>
defaults to the current time zone rule.
