<h4 class="subsection">25.6.2 Distinguishing Kinds of Files</h4>

<p><a name="index-file-classification-2255"></a><a name="index-classification-of-file-types-2256"></a><a name="index-symbolic-links-2257"></a>
  This section describes how to distinguish various kinds of files, such
as directories, symbolic links, and ordinary files.

   </p><p>Symbolic links are ordinarily followed wherever they appear.  For
example, to interpret the file name <samp><span class="file">a/b/c</span></samp>, any of <samp><span class="file">a</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">a/b</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="file">a/b/c</span></samp> can be symbolic links that are followed,
possibly recursively if the link targets are themselves symbolic
links.  However, a few functions do not follow symbolic links at the
end of a file name (<samp><span class="file">a/b/c</span></samp> in this example).  Such a function
is said to <dfn>not follow symbolic links</dfn>.

</p><div class="defun">
— Function: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Function/file%2Dsymlink%2Dp"></a><b>file-symlink-p</b><var> filename<a name="index-file_002dsymlink_002dp-2258"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-symbolic-links-2259"></a>If the file <var>filename</var> is a symbolic link, this function does not
follow it and instead returns its link target
as a string.  (The link target string is not necessarily the full
absolute file name of the target; determining the full file name that
the link points to is nontrivial, see below.)

        </p><p>If the file <var>filename</var> is not a symbolic link, or does not exist,
<code>file-symlink-p</code> returns <code>nil</code>.

        </p><p>Here are a few examples of using this function:

     </p><pre class="example">          (file-symlink-p "not-a-symlink")
               ⇒ nil
          (file-symlink-p "sym-link")
               ⇒ "not-a-symlink"
          (file-symlink-p "sym-link2")
               ⇒ "sym-link"
          (file-symlink-p "/bin")
               ⇒ "/pub/bin"
</pre>
        <p>Note that in the third example, the function returned <samp><span class="file">sym-link</span></samp>,
but did not proceed to resolve it, although that file is itself a
symbolic link.  That is because this function does not follow symbolic
links—the process of following the symbolic links does not apply to
the last component of the file name.

        </p><p>The string that this function returns is what is recorded in the
symbolic link; it may or may not include any leading directories. 
This function does <em>not</em> expand the link target to produce a
fully-qualified file name, and in particular does not use the leading
directories, if any, of the <var>filename</var> argument if the link target
is not an absolute file name.  Here's an example:

     </p><pre class="example">          (file-symlink-p "/foo/bar/baz")
               ⇒ "some-file"
</pre>
        <p class="noindent">Here, although <samp><span class="file">/foo/bar/baz</span></samp> was given as a fully-qualified file
name, the result is not, and in fact does not have any leading
directories at all.  And since <samp><span class="file">some-file</span></samp> might itself be a
symbolic link, you cannot simply prepend leading directories to it,
nor even naively use <code>expand-file-name</code> (see <a href="File-Name-Expansion.html#File-Name-Expansion">File Name Expansion</a>) to produce its absolute file name.

        </p><p>For this reason, this function is seldom useful if you need to
determine more than just the fact that a file is or isn't a symbolic
link.  If you actually need the file name of the link target, use
<code>file-chase-links</code> or <code>file-truename</code>, described in
<a href="Truenames.html#Truenames">Truenames</a>.
