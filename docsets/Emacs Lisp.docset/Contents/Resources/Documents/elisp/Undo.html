<h3 class="section">32.9 Undo</h3>

<p><a name="index-redo-3522"></a>
  Most buffers have an <dfn>undo list</dfn>, which records all changes made
to the buffer's text so that they can be undone.  (The buffers that
don't have one are usually special-purpose buffers for which Emacs
assumes that undoing is not useful.  In particular, any buffer whose
name begins with a space has its undo recording off by default;
see <a href="Buffer-Names.html#Buffer-Names">Buffer Names</a>.)  All the primitives that modify the
text in the buffer automatically add elements to the front of the undo
list, which is in the variable <code>buffer-undo-list</code>.

</p><div class="defun">
— Variable: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/buffer%2Dundo%2Dlist"></a><b>buffer-undo-list</b><var><a name="index-buffer_002dundo_002dlist-3523"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This buffer-local variable's value is the undo list of the current
buffer.  A value of <code>t</code> disables the recording of undo information. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Here are the kinds of elements an undo list can have:

     </p><dl>
<dt><var>position</var></dt><dd>This kind of element records a previous value of point; undoing this
element moves point to <var>position</var>.  Ordinary cursor motion does not
make any sort of undo record, but deletion operations use these entries
to record where point was before the command.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(</code><var>beg</var><code> . </code><var>end</var><code>)</code></dt><dd>This kind of element indicates how to delete text that was inserted. 
Upon insertion, the text occupied the range <var>beg</var>–<var>end</var> in the
buffer.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(</code><var>text</var><code> . </code><var>position</var><code>)</code></dt><dd>This kind of element indicates how to reinsert text that was deleted. 
The deleted text itself is the string <var>text</var>.  The place to
reinsert it is <code>(abs </code><var>position</var><code>)</code>.  If <var>position</var> is
positive, point was at the beginning of the deleted text, otherwise it
was at the end.  Zero or more (<var>marker</var> . <var>adjustment</var>)
elements follow immediately after this element.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(t . </code><var>time-flag</var><code>)</code></dt><dd>This kind of element indicates that an unmodified buffer became
modified.  A <var>time-flag</var> of the form
<code>(</code><var>sec-high</var> <var>sec-low</var> <var>microsec</var>
<var>picosec</var><code>)</code> represents the visited file's modification time as of
when it was previously visited or saved, using the same format as
<code>current-time</code>; see <a href="Time-of-Day.html#Time-of-Day">Time of Day</a>. 
A <var>time-flag</var> of 0 means the buffer does not correspond to any file;
−1 means the visited file previously did not exist. 
<code>primitive-undo</code> uses these
values to determine whether to mark the buffer as unmodified once again;
it does so only if the file's status matches that of <var>time-flag</var>.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(nil </code><var>property</var> <var>value</var> <var>beg</var><code> . </code><var>end</var><code>)</code></dt><dd>This kind of element records a change in a text property. 
Here's how you might undo the change:

     <pre class="example">          (put-text-property <var>beg</var> <var>end</var> <var>property</var> <var>value</var>)
</pre>
     <br></dd><dt><code>(</code><var>marker</var><code> . </code><var>adjustment</var><code>)</code></dt><dd>This kind of element records the fact that the marker <var>marker</var> was
relocated due to deletion of surrounding text, and that it moved
<var>adjustment</var> character positions.  If the marker's location is
consistent with the (<var>text</var> . <var>position</var>) element preceding it
in the undo list, then undoing this element moves <var>marker</var>
− <var>adjustment</var> characters.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(apply </code><var>funname</var><code> . </code><var>args</var><code>)</code></dt><dd>This is an extensible undo item, which is undone by calling
<var>funname</var> with arguments <var>args</var>.

     <br></dd><dt><code>(apply </code><var>delta</var> <var>beg</var> <var>end</var> <var>funname</var><code> . </code><var>args</var><code>)</code></dt><dd>This is an extensible undo item, which records a change limited to the
range <var>beg</var> to <var>end</var>, which increased the size of the buffer
by <var>delta</var> characters.  It is undone by calling <var>funname</var> with
arguments <var>args</var>.

     <p>This kind of element enables undo limited to a region to determine
whether the element pertains to that region.

     <br></p></dd><dt><code>nil</code></dt><dd>This element is a boundary.  The elements between two boundaries are
called a <dfn>change group</dfn>; normally, each change group corresponds to
one keyboard command, and undo commands normally undo an entire group as
a unit. 
</dd></dl>

<div class="defun">
— Function: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Function/undo%2Dboundary"></a><b>undo-boundary</b><var><a name="index-undo_002dboundary-3524"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function places a boundary element in the undo list.  The undo
command stops at such a boundary, and successive undo commands undo
to earlier and earlier boundaries.  This function returns <code>nil</code>.

        </p><p>Calling this function explicitly is useful for splitting the effects of
a command into more than one unit.  For example, <code>query-replace</code>
calls <code>undo-boundary</code> after each replacement, so that the user can
undo individual replacements one by one.

        </p><p>Mostly, however, this function is called automatically at an
appropriate time. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">

<blockquote><p><a name="index-amalgamating-commands_002c-and-undo-3526"></a>The editor command loop automatically calls <code>undo-boundary</code> just
before executing each key sequence, so that each undo normally undoes
the effects of one command.  A few exceptional commands are
<dfn>amalgamating</dfn>: these commands generally cause small changes to
buffers, so with these a boundary is inserted only every 20th command,
allowing the changes to be undone as a group.  By default, the commands
<code>self-insert-command</code>, which produces self-inserting input
characters (see <a href="Commands-for-Insertion.html#Commands-for-Insertion">Commands for Insertion</a>), and <code>delete-char</code>,
which deletes characters (see <a href="Deletion.html#Deletion">Deletion</a>), are amalgamating. 
Where a command affects the contents of several buffers, as may happen,
for example, when a function on the <code>post-command-hook</code> affects a
buffer other than the <code>current-buffer</code>, then <code>undo-boundary</code>
will be called in each of the affected buffers.

It undoes the first <var>count</var> elements of <var>list</var>, returning
the rest of <var>list</var>.

        </p><p><code>primitive-undo</code> adds elements to the buffer's undo list when it
changes the buffer.  Undo commands avoid confusion by saving the undo
list value at the beginning of a sequence of undo operations.  Then the
undo operations use and update the saved value.  The new elements added
by undoing are not part of this saved value, so they don't interfere with
continuing to undo.
