<h3 class="section">39.8 Temporary Displays</h3>

<p><a name="index-temporary-display-4497"></a><a name="index-temporary-buffer-display-4498"></a>
  Temporary displays are used by Lisp programs to put output into a
buffer and then present it to the user for perusal rather than for
editing.  Many help commands use this feature.

</p><div class="defun">
— Macro: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Macro/with%2Doutput%2Dto%2Dtemp%2Dbuffer"></a><b>with-output-to-temp-buffer</b><var> buffer-name body<small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-with_002doutput_002dto_002dtemp_002dbuffer-4499"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function executes the forms in <var>body</var> while arranging to insert
any output they print into the buffer named <var>buffer-name</var>, which is
first created if necessary, and put into Help mode.  (See the similar
form <code>with-temp-buffer-window</code> below.)  Finally, the buffer is
displayed in some window, but that window is not selected.

        </p><p>If the forms in <var>body</var> do not change the major mode in the output
buffer, so that it is still Help mode at the end of their execution,
then <code>with-output-to-temp-buffer</code> makes this buffer read-only at
the end, and also scans it for function and variable names to make them
into clickable cross-references.  See <a href="Docstring-hyperlinks.html#Docstring-hyperlinks">Tips for Documentation Strings</a>, in particular the item on hyperlinks in
documentation strings, for more details.

        </p><p>The string <var>buffer-name</var> specifies the temporary buffer, which need
not already exist.  The argument must be a string, not a buffer.  The
buffer is erased initially (with no questions asked), and it is marked
as unmodified after <code>with-output-to-temp-buffer</code> exits.

        </p><p><code>with-output-to-temp-buffer</code> binds <code>standard-output</code> to the
temporary buffer, then it evaluates the forms in <var>body</var>.  Output
using the Lisp output functions within <var>body</var> goes by default to
that buffer (but screen display and messages in the echo area, although
they are “output” in the general sense of the word, are not affected). 
See <a href="Output-Functions.html#Output-Functions">Output Functions</a>.

        </p><p>Several hooks are available for customizing the behavior
of this construct; they are listed below.

        </p><p>The value of the last form in <var>body</var> is returned.

     </p><pre class="example">          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
           This is the contents of foo.
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          
          (with-output-to-temp-buffer "foo"
              (print 20)
              (print standard-output))
          ⇒ #&lt;buffer foo&gt;
          
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          
          20
          
          #&lt;buffer foo&gt;
          
          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------

<blockquote><p>This macro is similar to <code>with-output-to-temp-buffer</code>.  Like that
construct, it executes <var>body</var> while arranging to insert any output
it prints into the buffer named <var>buffer-or-name</var> and displays that
buffer in some window.  Unlike <code>with-output-to-temp-buffer</code>,
however, it does not automatically switch that buffer to Help mode.

        </p><p>The argument <var>buffer-or-name</var> specifies the temporary buffer.  It
can be either a buffer, which must already exist, or a string, in which
case a buffer of that name is created, if necessary.  The buffer is
marked as unmodified and read-only when <code>with-temp-buffer-window</code>
exits.

        </p><p>This macro does not call <code>temp-buffer-show-function</code>.  Rather, it
passes the <var>action</var> argument to <code>display-buffer</code>
(see <a href="Choosing-Window.html#Choosing-Window">Choosing Window</a>) in order to display the buffer.

        </p><p>The value of the last form in <var>body</var> is returned, unless the
argument <var>quit-function</var> is specified.  In that case, it is called
with two arguments: the window showing the buffer and the result of
<var>body</var>.  The final return value is then whatever <var>quit-function</var>
returns.

   <p>The two constructs described next are mostly identical to

<div class="defun">

   <p>A window showing a temporary buffer can be fitted to the size of that
buffer using the following mode:

</p><div class="defun">
— User Option: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Option/temp%2Dbuffer%2Dresize%2Dmode"></a><b>temp-buffer-resize-mode</b><var><a name="index-temp_002dbuffer_002dresize_002dmode-4508"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>When this minor mode is enabled, windows showing a temporary buffer are
automatically resized to fit their buffer's contents.

        </p><p>A window is resized if and only if it has been specially created for the
buffer.  In particular, windows that have shown another buffer before
are not resized.  By default, this mode uses <code>fit-window-to-buffer</code>
(see <a href="Resizing-Windows.html#Resizing-Windows">Resizing Windows</a>) for resizing.  You can specify a different
function by customizing the options <code>temp-buffer-max-height</code> and
<code>temp-buffer-max-width</code> below. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
— User Option: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Option/temp%2Dbuffer%2Dmax%2Dheight"></a><b>temp-buffer-max-height</b><var><a name="index-temp_002dbuffer_002dmax_002dheight-4509"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This option specifies the maximum height (in lines) of a window
displaying a temporary buffer when <code>temp-buffer-resize-mode</code> is
enabled.  It can also be a function to be called to choose the height
for such a buffer.  It gets one argument, the buffer, and should return
a positive integer.  At the time the function is called, the window to
be resized is selected. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
— User Option: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Option/temp%2Dbuffer%2Dmax%2Dwidth"></a><b>temp-buffer-max-width</b><var><a name="index-temp_002dbuffer_002dmax_002dwidth-4510"></a></var><br>

positive integer.  At the time the function is called, the window to be
resized is selected. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The following function uses the current buffer for temporary display:

</p><div class="defun">
— Function: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Function/momentary%2Dstring%2Ddisplay"></a><b>momentary-string-display</b><var> string position &amp;optional char message<a name="index-momentary_002dstring_002ddisplay-4511"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function momentarily displays <var>string</var> in the current buffer at
<var>position</var>.  It has no effect on the undo list or on the buffer's
modification status.

        </p><p>The momentary display remains until the next input event.  If the next
input event is <var>char</var>, <code>momentary-string-display</code> ignores it
and returns.  Otherwise, that event remains buffered for subsequent use
as input.  Thus, typing <var>char</var> will simply remove the string from
the display, while typing (say) <kbd>C-f</kbd> will remove the string from
the display and later (presumably) move point forward.  The argument
<var>char</var> is a space by default.

        </p><p>The return value of <code>momentary-string-display</code> is not meaningful.

        </p><p>If the string <var>string</var> does not contain control characters, you can
do the same job in a more general way by creating (and then subsequently
deleting) an overlay with a <code>before-string</code> property. 
See <a href="Overlay-Properties.html#Overlay-Properties">Overlay Properties</a>.

        </p><p>If <var>message</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it is displayed in the echo area
while <var>string</var> is displayed in the buffer.  If it is <code>nil</code>, a
default message says to type <var>char</var> to continue.

        </p><p>In this example, point is initially located at the beginning of the
second line:

     </p><pre class="example">          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          This is the contents of foo.
          -!-Second line.

          ---------- Buffer: foo ----------
          This is the contents of foo.
          **** Important Message! ****Second line.
