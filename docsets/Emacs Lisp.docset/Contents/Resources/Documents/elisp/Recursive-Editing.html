<h3 class="section">21.13 Recursive Editing</h3>

<p><a name="index-recursive-command-loop-1764"></a><a name="index-recursive-editing-level-1765"></a><a name="index-command-loop_002c-recursive-1766"></a>
  The Emacs command loop is entered automatically when Emacs starts up. 
This top-level invocation of the command loop never exits; it keeps
running as long as Emacs does.  Lisp programs can also invoke the
command loop.  Since this makes more than one activation of the command
loop, we call it <dfn>recursive editing</dfn>.  A recursive editing level has
the effect of suspending whatever command invoked it and permitting the
user to do arbitrary editing before resuming that command.

   </p><p>The commands available during recursive editing are the same ones
available in the top-level editing loop and defined in the keymaps. 
Only a few special commands exit the recursive editing level; the others
return to the recursive editing level when they finish.  (The special
commands for exiting are always available, but they do nothing when
recursive editing is not in progress.)

   </p><p>All command loops, including recursive ones, set up all-purpose error
handlers so that an error in a command run from the command loop will
not exit the loop.

   </p><p><a name="index-minibuffer-input-1767"></a>  Minibuffer input is a special kind of recursive editing.  It has a few
special wrinkles, such as enabling display of the minibuffer and the
minibuffer window, but fewer than you might suppose.  Certain keys
behave differently in the minibuffer, but that is only because of the
minibuffer's local map; if you switch windows, you get the usual Emacs
commands.

   </p><p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bthrow_007d-example-1768"></a><a name="index-exit-1769"></a><a name="index-exit-recursive-editing-1770"></a><a name="index-aborting-1771"></a>  To invoke a recursive editing level, call the function
<code>recursive-edit</code>.  This function contains the command loop; it also
contains a call to <code>catch</code> with tag <code>exit</code>, which makes it
possible to exit the recursive editing level by throwing to <code>exit</code>
(see <a href="Catch-and-Throw.html#Catch-and-Throw">Catch and Throw</a>).  If you throw a value other than <code>t</code>,
then <code>recursive-edit</code> returns normally to the function that called
it.  The command <kbd>C-M-c</kbd> (<code>exit-recursive-edit</code>) does this. 
Throwing a <code>t</code> value causes <code>recursive-edit</code> to quit, so that
control returns to the command loop one level up.  This is called
<dfn>aborting</dfn>, and is done by <kbd>C-]</kbd> (<code>abort-recursive-edit</code>).

   </p><p>Most applications should not use recursive editing, except as part of
using the minibuffer.  Usually it is more convenient for the user if you
change the major mode of the current buffer temporarily to a special
major mode, which should have a command to go back to the previous mode. 
(The <kbd>e</kbd> command in Rmail uses this technique.)  Or, if you wish to
give the user different text to edit recursively, create and select
a new buffer in a special mode.  In this mode, define a command to
complete the processing and go back to the previous buffer.  (The
<kbd>m</kbd> command in Rmail does this.)

   </p><p>Recursive edits are useful in debugging.  You can insert a call to
<code>debug</code> into a function definition as a sort of breakpoint, so that
you can look around when the function gets there.  <code>debug</code> invokes
a recursive edit but also provides the other features of the debugger.

   </p><p>Recursive editing levels are also used when you type <kbd>C-r</kbd> in
<code>query-replace</code> or use <kbd>C-x q</kbd> (<code>kbd-macro-query</code>).

<blockquote><p><a name="index-suspend-evaluation-1773"></a>This function invokes the editor command loop.  It is called
automatically by the initialization of Emacs, to let the user begin
editing.  When called from a Lisp program, it enters a recursive editing
level.

        </p><p>If the current buffer is not the same as the selected window's buffer,
<code>recursive-edit</code> saves and restores the current buffer.  Otherwise,
if you switch buffers, the buffer you switched to is current after
<code>recursive-edit</code> returns.

        </p><p>In the following example, the function <code>simple-rec</code> first
advances point one word, then enters a recursive edit, printing out a
message in the echo area.  The user can then do any editing desired, and
then type <kbd>C-M-c</kbd> to exit and continue executing <code>simple-rec</code>.

     </p><pre class="example">          (defun simple-rec ()
            (forward-word 1)
            (message "Recursive edit in progress")
            (recursive-edit)
            (forward-word 1))
               ⇒ simple-rec
          (simple-rec)
