<h4 class="subsection">40.1.4 Command-Line Arguments</h4>

<p><a name="index-command_002dline-arguments-5016"></a>
  You can use command-line arguments to request various actions when
you start Emacs.  Note that the recommended way of using Emacs is to
start it just once, after logging in, and then do all editing in the same
Emacs session (see <a href="../emacs/Entering-Emacs.html#Entering-Emacs">Entering Emacs</a>). 
For this reason, you might not use command-line arguments very often;
nonetheless, they can be useful when invoking Emacs from session
scripts or debugging Emacs.  This section describes how Emacs
processes command-line arguments.

</p><div class="defun">
— Function: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Function/command%2Dline"></a><b>command-line</b><var><a name="index-command_002dline-5017"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function parses the command line that Emacs was called with,
processes it, and (amongst other things) loads the user's init file and
displays the startup messages. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
— Variable: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/command%2Dline%2Dprocessed"></a><b>command-line-processed</b><var><a name="index-command_002dline_002dprocessed-5018"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is <code>t</code> once the command line has been
processed.

        </p><p>If you redump Emacs by calling <code>dump-emacs</code> (see <a href="Building-Emacs.html#Building-Emacs">Building Emacs</a>), you may wish to set this variable to <code>nil</code> first in
order to cause the new dumped Emacs to process its new command-line
arguments. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
— Variable: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Variable/command%2Dswitch%2Dalist"></a><b>command-switch-alist</b><var><a name="index-command_002dswitch_002dalist-5019"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><a name="index-switches-on-command-line-5020"></a><a name="index-options-on-command-line-5021"></a><a name="index-command_002dline-options-5022"></a>This variable is an alist of user-defined command-line options and
associated handler functions.  By default it is empty, but you can
add elements if you wish.

        </p><p>A <dfn>command-line option</dfn> is an argument on the command line, which
has the form:

     </p><pre class="example">          -<var>option</var>
</pre>
        <p>The elements of the <code>command-switch-alist</code> look like this:

     </p><pre class="example">          (<var>option</var> . <var>handler-function</var>)
</pre>
        <p>The <span class="sc">car</span>, <var>option</var>, is a string, the name of a command-line
option (not including the initial hyphen).  The <var>handler-function</var>
is called to handle <var>option</var>, and receives the option name as its
sole argument.

        </p><p>In some cases, the option is followed in the command line by an
argument.  In these cases, the <var>handler-function</var> can find all the
remaining command-line arguments in the variable
<code>command-line-args-left</code> (see below).  (The entire list of
command-line arguments is in <code>command-line-args</code>.)

        </p><p>The command-line arguments are parsed by the <code>command-line-1</code>
function in the <samp><span class="file">startup.el</span></samp> file.  See also <a href="../emacs/Emacs-Invocation.html#Emacs-Invocation">Command Line Arguments for Emacs Invocation</a>.

<blockquote><p>This variable's value is a list of functions for handling an
unrecognized command-line argument.  Each time the next argument to be
processed has no special meaning, the functions in this list are called,
in order of appearance, until one of them returns a non-<code>nil</code>
value.

        </p><p>These functions are called with no arguments.  They can access the
command-line argument under consideration through the variable
<code>argi</code>, which is bound temporarily at this point.  The remaining
arguments (not including the current one) are in the variable
<code>command-line-args-left</code>.

        </p><p>When a function recognizes and processes the argument in <code>argi</code>, it
should return a non-<code>nil</code> value to say it has dealt with that
argument.  If it has also dealt with some of the following arguments, it
can indicate that by deleting them from <code>command-line-args-left</code>.

        </p><p>If all of these functions return <code>nil</code>, then the argument is treated
as a file name to visit.
