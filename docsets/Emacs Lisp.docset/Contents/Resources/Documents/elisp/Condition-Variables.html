<h3 class="section">37.3 Condition Variables</h3>

<p>A <dfn>condition variable</dfn> is a way for a thread to block until some
event occurs.  A thread can wait on a condition variable, to be woken
up when some other thread notifies the condition.

   </p><p>A condition variable is associated with a mutex and, conceptually,
with some condition.  For proper operation, the mutex must be
acquired, and then a waiting thread must loop, testing the condition
and waiting on the condition variable.  For example:

</p><pre class="example">     (with-mutex mutex
       (while (not global-variable)
         (condition-wait cond-var)))
</pre>
   <p>The mutex ensures atomicity, and the loop is for robustness—there
may be spurious notifications.

   </p><p>Similarly, the mutex must be held before notifying the condition. 
The typical, and best, approach is to acquire the mutex, make the
changes associated with this condition, and then notify it:

</p><pre class="example">     (with-mutex mutex
       (setq global-variable (some-computation))
       (condition-notify cond-var))
</pre>
   <div class="defun">
— Function: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Function/make%2Dcondition%2Dvariable"></a><b>make-condition-variable</b><var> mutex &amp;optional name<a name="index-make_002dcondition_002dvariable-4250"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Make a new condition variable associated with <var>mutex</var>.  If
<var>name</var> is specified, it is a name given to the condition variable. 
It must be a string.  The name is for debugging purposes only; it has
no meaning to Emacs.

This function will block until the condition is notified, or until a
signal is delivered to this thread using <code>thread-signal</code>.

        </p><p>It is an error to call <code>condition-wait</code> without holding the
condition's associated mutex.

        </p><p><code>condition-wait</code> releases the associated mutex while waiting. 
This allows other threads to acquire the mutex in order to notify the
condition.

<blockquote><p>Notify <var>cond</var>.  The mutex with <var>cond</var> must be held before

threads waiting on <var>cond</var> are notified.
