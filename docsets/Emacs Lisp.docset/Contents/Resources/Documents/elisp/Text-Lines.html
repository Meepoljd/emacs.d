<h4 class="subsection">30.2.4 Motion by Text Lines</h4>

<p><a name="index-lines-3332"></a>
  Text lines are portions of the buffer delimited by newline characters,
which are regarded as part of the previous line.  The first text line
begins at the beginning of the buffer, and the last text line ends at
the end of the buffer whether or not the last character is a newline. 
The division of the buffer into text lines is not affected by the width
of the window, by line continuation in display, or by how tabs and
control characters are displayed.

field boundaries, either bind <code>inhibit-field-text-motion</code> to
<code>t</code>, or use the <code>forward-line</code> function instead.  For
instance, <code>(forward-line 0)</code> does the same thing as
<code>(beginning-of-line)</code>, except that it ignores field boundaries.

number of lines actually moved.  If you attempt to move down five lines
from the beginning of a buffer that has only three lines, point stops at
the end of the last line, and the value will be 2.  As an explicit
exception, if the last accessible line is non-empty, but has no
newline (e.g., if the buffer ends without a newline), the function
sets point to the end of that line, and the value returned by the
function counts that line as one line successfully moved.

These functions do not move point, but test whether it is already at the
beginning or end of a line.
