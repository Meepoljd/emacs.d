<h4 class="subsection">28.19.2 Side Window Options and Functions</h4>

<p>The following options provide additional control over the placement of
side windows.

</p><div class="defun">
— User Option: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Option/window%2Dsides%2Dvertical"></a><b>window-sides-vertical</b><var><a name="index-window_002dsides_002dvertical-2781"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If non-<code>nil</code>, the side windows on the left and right of a frame
occupy the frame's full height.  Otherwise, the side windows on the top
and bottom of the frame occupy the frame's full width. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
— User Option: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Option/window%2Dsides%2Dslots"></a><b>window-sides-slots</b><var><a name="index-window_002dsides_002dslots-2782"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This option specifies the maximum number of side windows on each side of
a frame.  The value is a list of four elements specifying the number of
side window slots on (in this order) the left, top, right and bottom of
each frame.  If an element is a number, it means to display at most that
many windows on the corresponding side.  If an element is <code>nil</code>, it
means there's no bound on the number of slots on that side.

        </p><p>If any of the specified values is zero, no window can be created on the
corresponding side.  <code>display-buffer-in-side-window</code> will not
signal an error in that case, but will return <code>nil</code>.  If a specified
value just forbids the creation of an additional side window, the most
suitable window on that side is reused and may have its
<code>window-slot</code> parameter changed accordingly. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
— User Option: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Option/window%2Dsides%2Dreversed"></a><b>window-sides-reversed</b><var><a name="index-window_002dsides_002dreversed-2783"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This option specifies whether top/bottom side windows should appear in
reverse order.  When this is <code>nil</code>, side windows on the top and
bottom of a frame are always drawn from left to right with increasing
slot values.  When this is <code>t</code>, the drawing order is reversed and
side windows on the top and bottom of a frame are drawn from right to
left with increasing slot values.

        </p><p>When this is <code>bidi</code>, the drawing order is reversed if and only if
the value of <code>bidi-paragraph-direction</code> (see <a href="Bidirectional-Display.html#Bidirectional-Display">Bidirectional Display</a>) is <code>right-to-left</code> in the buffer displayed in the window
most recently selected within the main window area of this frame. 
Sometimes that window may be hard to find, so heuristics are used to
avoid that the drawing order changes inadvertently when another window
gets selected.

        </p><p>The layout of side windows on the left or right of a frame is not
affected by the value of this variable. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>When a frame has side windows, the following function returns the main
window of that frame.

</p><div class="defun">
— Function: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Function/window%2Dmain%2Dwindow"></a><b>window-main-window</b><var> &amp;optional frame<a name="index-window_002dmain_002dwindow-2784"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the main window of the specified <var>frame</var>.  The
optional argument <var>frame</var> must be a live frame and defaults to the
selected one.

        </p><p>If <var>frame</var> has no side windows, it returns <var>frame</var>'s root
window.  Otherwise, it returns either an internal non-side window such
that all other non-side windows on <var>frame</var> descend from it, or the
single live non-side window of <var>frame</var>.  Note that the main window
of a frame cannot be deleted via <code>delete-window</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The following command is handy to toggle the appearance of all side
windows on a specified frame.

</p><div class="defun">
— Command: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Command/window%2Dtoggle%2Dside%2Dwindows"></a><b>window-toggle-side-windows</b><var> &amp;optional frame<a name="index-window_002dtoggle_002dside_002dwindows-2785"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This command toggles side windows on the specified <var>frame</var>.  The
optional argument <var>frame</var> must be a live frame and defaults to the
selected one.

        </p><p>If <var>frame</var> has at least one side window, this command saves the
state of <var>frame</var>'s root window in the <var>frame</var>'s
<code>window-state</code> frame parameter and deletes all side windows on
<var>frame</var> afterwards.

        </p><p>If <var>frame</var> has no side windows, but does have a <code>window-state</code>
parameter, this command uses that parameter's value to restore the side
windows on <var>frame</var> leaving <var>frame</var>'s main window alone.

        </p><p>An error is signaled if <var>frame</var> has no side windows and no saved
state is found for it. 
</p></blockquote></div>
