<h4 class="subsection">29.3.1 Frame Layout</h4>

<p><a name="index-frame-layout-2946"></a><a name="index-layout-of-frame-2947"></a>
A visible frame occupies a rectangular area on its terminal's display. 
This area may contain a number of nested rectangles, each serving a
different purpose.  The drawing below sketches the layout of a frame on
a graphical terminal:

   <p>In practice not all of the areas shown in the drawing will or may be
present.  The meaning of these areas is described below.

     </p><dl>
<dt>‘<samp><span class="samp">Outer Frame</span></samp>’</dt><dd><a name="index-outer-frame-2948"></a><a name="index-outer-edges-2949"></a><a name="index-outer-width-2950"></a><a name="index-outer-height-2951"></a><a name="index-outer-size-2952"></a>The <dfn>outer frame</dfn> is a rectangle comprising all areas shown in the
drawing.  The edges of that rectangle are called the <dfn>outer edges</dfn>
of the frame.  Together, the <dfn>outer width</dfn> and <dfn>outer height</dfn> of
the frame specify the <dfn>outer size</dfn> of that rectangle.

     <p>Knowing the outer size of a frame is useful for fitting a frame into the
working area of its display (see <a href="Multiple-Terminals.html#Multiple-Terminals">Multiple Terminals</a>) or for placing
two frames adjacent to each other on the screen.  Usually, the outer
size of a frame is available only after the frame has been mapped (made
visible, see <a href="Visibility-of-Frames.html#Visibility-of-Frames">Visibility of Frames</a>) at least once.  For the initial
frame or a frame that has not been created yet, the outer size can be
only estimated or must be calculated from the window-system's or window
manager's defaults.  One workaround is to obtain the differences of the
outer and native (see below) sizes of a mapped frame and use them for
calculating the outer size of the new frame.

     </p><p><a name="index-outer-position-2953"></a>The position of the upper left corner of the outer frame (indicated by
‘<samp><span class="samp">(0)</span></samp>’ in the drawing above) is the <dfn>outer position</dfn> of the
frame.  The outer position of a graphical frame is also referred to as
“the position” of the frame because it usually remains unchanged on
its display whenever the frame is resized or its layout is changed.

     </p><p>The outer position is specified by and can be set via the <code>left</code>
and <code>top</code> frame parameters (see <a href="Position-Parameters.html#Position-Parameters">Position Parameters</a>).  For a
normal, top-level frame these parameters usually represent its absolute
position (see below) with respect to its display's origin.  For a child
frame (see <a href="Child-Frames.html#Child-Frames">Child Frames</a>) these parameters represent its position
relative to the native position (see below) of its parent frame.  For
frames on text terminals the values of these parameters are meaningless
and always zero.

     <br></p></dd><dt>‘<samp><span class="samp">External Border</span></samp>’</dt><dd><a name="index-external-border-2954"></a>The <dfn>external border</dfn> is part of the decorations supplied by the
window manager.  It is typically used for resizing the frame with the
mouse and is therefore not shown on “fullboth” and maximized frames
(see <a href="Size-Parameters.html#Size-Parameters">Size Parameters</a>).  Its width is determined by the window
manager and cannot be changed by Emacs' functions.

     <p>External borders don't exist on text terminal frames.  For graphical
frames, their display can be suppressed by setting the
<code>override-redirect</code> or <code>undecorated</code> frame parameter
(see <a href="Management-Parameters.html#Management-Parameters">Management Parameters</a>).

     <br></p></dd><dt>‘<samp><span class="samp">Outer Border</span></samp>’</dt><dd><a name="index-outer-border-2955"></a>The <dfn>outer border</dfn> is a separate border whose width can be specified
with the <code>border-width</code> frame parameter (see <a href="Layout-Parameters.html#Layout-Parameters">Layout Parameters</a>).  In practice, either the external or the outer border of a
frame are displayed but never both at the same time.  Usually, the outer
border is shown only for special frames that are not (fully) controlled
by the window manager like tooltip frames (see <a href="Tooltips.html#Tooltips">Tooltips</a>), child
frames (see <a href="Child-Frames.html#Child-Frames">Child Frames</a>) and <code>undecorated</code> or
<code>override-redirect</code> frames (see <a href="Management-Parameters.html#Management-Parameters">Management Parameters</a>).

     <p>Outer borders are never shown on text terminal frames and on frames
generated by GTK+ routines.  On MS-Windows, the outer border is emulated
with the help of a one pixel wide external border.  Non-toolkit builds
on X allow to change the color of the outer border by setting the
<code>border-color</code> frame parameter (see <a href="Layout-Parameters.html#Layout-Parameters">Layout Parameters</a>).

     <br></p></dd><dt>‘<samp><span class="samp">Title Bar</span></samp>’</dt><dd><a name="index-title-bar-2956"></a><a name="index-caption-bar-2957"></a>The <dfn>title bar</dfn>, a.k.a. <dfn>caption bar</dfn>, is also part of the
window manager's decorations and typically displays the title of the
frame (see <a href="Frame-Titles.html#Frame-Titles">Frame Titles</a>) as well as buttons for minimizing,
maximizing and deleting the frame.  It can be also used for dragging
the frame with the mouse.  The title bar is usually not displayed for
fullboth (see <a href="Size-Parameters.html#Size-Parameters">Size Parameters</a>), tooltip (see <a href="Tooltips.html#Tooltips">Tooltips</a>) and
child frames (see <a href="Child-Frames.html#Child-Frames">Child Frames</a>) and doesn't exist for terminal
frames.  Display of the title bar can be suppressed by setting the
<code>override-redirect</code> or the <code>undecorated</code> frame parameters
(see <a href="Management-Parameters.html#Management-Parameters">Management Parameters</a>).

     <br></dd><dt>‘<samp><span class="samp">Menu Bar</span></samp>’</dt><dd><a name="index-internal-menu-bar-2958"></a><a name="index-external-menu-bar-2959"></a>The menu bar (see <a href="Menu-Bar.html#Menu-Bar">Menu Bar</a>) can be either internal (drawn by Emacs
itself) or external (drawn by the toolkit).  Most builds (GTK+, Lucid,
Motif and MS-Windows) rely on an external menu bar.  NS also uses an
external menu bar which, however, is not part of the outer frame. 
Non-toolkit builds can provide an internal menu bar.  On text terminal
frames, the menu bar is part of the frame's root window (see <a href="Windows-and-Frames.html#Windows-and-Frames">Windows and Frames</a>).  As a rule, menu bars are never shown on child frames
(see <a href="Child-Frames.html#Child-Frames">Child Frames</a>).  Display of the menu bar can be suppressed by
setting the <code>menu-bar-lines</code> parameter (see <a href="Layout-Parameters.html#Layout-Parameters">Layout Parameters</a>)
to zero.

     <p>Whether the menu bar is wrapped or truncated whenever its width
becomes too large to fit on its frame depends on the toolkit . 
Usually, only Motif and MS-Windows builds can wrap the menu bar.  When
they (un-)wrap the menu bar, they try to keep the outer height of the
frame unchanged, so the native height of the frame (see below) will
change instead.

     <br></p></dd><dt>‘<samp><span class="samp">Tool Bar</span></samp>’</dt><dd><a name="index-internal-tool-bar-2960"></a><a name="index-external-tool-bar-2961"></a>Like the menu bar, the tool bar (see <a href="Tool-Bar.html#Tool-Bar">Tool Bar</a>) can be either
internal (drawn by Emacs itself) or external (drawn by a toolkit).  The
GTK+ and NS builds have the tool bar drawn by the toolkit.  The
remaining builds use internal tool bars.  With GTK+ the tool bar can be
located on either side of the frame, immediately outside the internal
border, see below.  Tool bars are usually not shown for child frames
(see <a href="Child-Frames.html#Child-Frames">Child Frames</a>).  Display of the tool bar can be suppressed by
setting the <code>tool-bar-lines</code> parameter (see <a href="Layout-Parameters.html#Layout-Parameters">Layout Parameters</a>) to zero.

     <p>If the variable <code>auto-resize-tool-bars</code> is non-<code>nil</code>, Emacs
wraps the internal tool bar when its width becomes too large for its
frame.  If and when Emacs (un-)wraps the internal tool bar, it by
default keeps the outer height of the frame unchanged, so the native
height of the frame (see below) will change instead.  Emacs built with
GTK+, on the other hand, never wraps the tool bar but may
automatically increase the outer width of a frame in order to
accommodate an overlong tool bar.

     <br></p></dd><dt>‘<samp><span class="samp">Native Frame</span></samp>’</dt><dd><a name="index-native-frame-2962"></a><a name="index-native-edges-2963"></a><a name="index-native-width-2964"></a><a name="index-native-height-2965"></a><a name="index-native-size-2966"></a>The <dfn>native frame</dfn> is a rectangle located entirely within the outer
frame.  It excludes the areas occupied by an external or outer border,
the title bar and any external menu or tool bar.  The edges of the
native frame are called the <dfn>native edges</dfn> of the frame.  Together,
the <dfn>native width</dfn> and <dfn>native height</dfn> of a frame specify the
<dfn>native size</dfn> of the frame.

     <p>The native size of a frame is the size Emacs passes to the window-system
or window manager when creating or resizing the frame from within Emacs. 
It is also the size Emacs receives from the window-system or window
manager whenever these resize the frame's window-system window, for
example, after maximizing the frame by clicking on the corresponding
button in the title bar or when dragging its external border with the
mouse.

     </p><p><a name="index-native-position-2967"></a>The position of the top left corner of the native frame specifies the
<dfn>native position</dfn> of the frame.  (1)–(3) in the drawing above
indicate that position for the various builds:

          </p><ul>
<li>(1) non-toolkit and terminal frames

          </li><li>(2) Lucid, Motif and MS-Windows frames

          </li><li>(3) GTK+ and NS frames
</li></ul>

     <p>Accordingly, the native height of a frame may include the height of the
tool bar but not that of the menu bar (Lucid, Motif, MS-Windows) or
those of the menu bar and the tool bar (non-toolkit and text terminal
frames).

     </p><p>The native position of a frame is the reference position for functions
that set or return the current position of the mouse (see <a href="Mouse-Position.html#Mouse-Position">Mouse Position</a>) and for functions dealing with the position of windows like
<code>window-edges</code>, <code>window-at</code> or <code>coordinates-in-window-p</code>
(see <a href="Coordinates-and-Windows.html#Coordinates-and-Windows">Coordinates and Windows</a>).  It also specifies the (0, 0) origin
for locating and positioning child frames within this frame
(see <a href="Child-Frames.html#Child-Frames">Child Frames</a>).

     </p><p>Note also that the native position of a frame usually remains unaltered
on its display when removing or adding the window manager decorations by
changing the frame's <code>override-redirect</code> or <code>undecorated</code>
parameter (see <a href="Management-Parameters.html#Management-Parameters">Management Parameters</a>).

     <br></p></dd><dt>‘<samp><span class="samp">Internal Border</span></samp>’</dt><dd>The internal border is a border drawn by Emacs around the inner frame
(see below).  Its width is specified by the <code>internal-border-width</code>
frame parameter (see <a href="Layout-Parameters.html#Layout-Parameters">Layout Parameters</a>).  Its color is specified by
the background of the <code>internal-border</code> face.

     <br></dd><dt>‘<samp><span class="samp">Inner Frame</span></samp>’</dt><dd><a name="index-inner-frame-2968"></a><a name="index-inner-edges-2969"></a><a name="index-inner-width-2970"></a><a name="index-inner-height-2971"></a><a name="index-inner-size-2972"></a><a name="index-display-area-2973"></a>The <dfn>inner frame</dfn> is the rectangle reserved for the frame's windows. 
It's enclosed by the internal border which, however, is not part of the
inner frame.  Its edges are called the <dfn>inner edges</dfn> of the frame. 
The <dfn>inner width</dfn> and <dfn>inner height</dfn> specify the <dfn>inner
size</dfn> of the rectangle.  The inner frame is sometimes also referred to
as the <dfn>display area</dfn> of the frame.

     <p><a name="index-minibuffer_002dless-frame-2974"></a><a name="index-minibuffer_002donly-frame-2975"></a>As a rule, the inner frame is subdivided into the frame's root window
(see <a href="Windows-and-Frames.html#Windows-and-Frames">Windows and Frames</a>) and the frame's minibuffer window
(see <a href="Minibuffer-Windows.html#Minibuffer-Windows">Minibuffer Windows</a>).  There are two notable exceptions to this
rule: A <dfn>minibuffer-less frame</dfn> contains a root window only and does
not contain a minibuffer window.  A <dfn>minibuffer-only frame</dfn> contains
only a minibuffer window which also serves as that frame's root window. 
See <a href="Initial-Parameters.html#Initial-Parameters">Initial Parameters</a> for how to create such frame
configurations.

     <br></p></dd><dt>‘<samp><span class="samp">Text Area</span></samp>’</dt><dd><a name="index-text-area-2976"></a>The <dfn>text area</dfn> of a frame is a somewhat fictitious area that can be
embedded in the native frame.  Its position is unspecified.  Its width
can be obtained by removing from that of the native width the widths of
the internal border, one vertical scroll bar, and one left and one right
fringe if they are specified for this frame, see <a href="Layout-Parameters.html#Layout-Parameters">Layout Parameters</a>.  Its height can be obtained by removing from that of the
native height the widths of the internal border and the heights of the
frame's internal menu and tool bars and one horizontal scroll bar if
specified for this frame. 
</dd></dl>

   <p><a name="index-absolute-position-2977"></a><a name="index-absolute-frame-position-2978"></a><a name="index-absolute-edges-2979"></a><a name="index-absolute-frame-edges-2980"></a><a name="index-display-origin-2981"></a><a name="index-origin-of-display-2982"></a>The <dfn>absolute position</dfn> of a frame is given as a pair (X, Y) of
horizontal and vertical pixel offsets relative to an origin (0, 0) of
the frame's display.  Correspondingly, the <dfn>absolute edges</dfn> of a
frame are given as pixel offsets from that origin.

   </p><p>Note that with multiple monitors, the origin of the display does not
necessarily coincide with the top-left corner of the entire usable
display area of the terminal.  Hence the absolute position of a frame
can be negative in such an environment even when that frame is
completely visible.

   </p><p>By convention, vertical offsets increase “downwards”.  This means
that the height of a frame is obtained by subtracting the offset of its
top edge from that of its bottom edge.  Horizontal offsets increase
“rightwards”, as expected, so a frame's width is calculated by
subtracting the offset of its left edge from that of its right edge.

   </p><p>For a frame on a graphical terminal the following function returns the
sizes of the areas described above:

that if <var>frame</var> has not been mapped yet, (see <a href="Visibility-of-Frames.html#Visibility-of-Frames">Visibility of Frames</a>) some of the return values may only represent approximations of
the actual values—those that can be seen after the frame has been

   <p>The following function can be used to retrieve the edges of the outer,
native and inner frame.

</p><div class="defun">
— Function: <a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/Function/frame%2Dedges"></a><b>frame-edges</b><var> &amp;optional frame type<a name="index-frame_002dedges-2984"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function returns the absolute edges of the outer, native or inner
frame of <var>frame</var>.  <var>frame</var> must be a live frame and defaults to
the selected one.  The returned list has the form <code>(</code><var>left</var><code>&nbsp;</code><var>top</var><code>&nbsp;</code><var>right</var><code>&nbsp;</code><var>bottom</var><code>)</code><!-- /@w --> where all values are in pixels
relative to the origin of <var>frame</var>'s display.  For terminal frames
the values returned for <var>left</var> and <var>top</var> are always zero.

        </p><p>Optional argument <var>type</var> specifies the type of the edges to return:
<code>outer-edges</code> means to return the outer edges of <var>frame</var>,
<code>native-edges</code> (or <code>nil</code>) means to return its native edges and
<code>inner-edges</code> means to return its inner edges.

        </p><p>By convention, the pixels of the display at the values returned for
<var>left</var> and <var>top</var> are considered to be inside (part of)
<var>frame</var>.  Hence, if <var>left</var> and <var>top</var> are both zero, the
pixel at the display's origin is part of <var>frame</var>.  The pixels at
<var>bottom</var> and <var>right</var>, on the other hand, are considered to lie
immediately outside <var>frame</var>.  This means that if you have, for
example, two side-by-side frames positioned such that the right outer
edge of the frame on the left equals the left outer edge of the frame on
the right, the pixels at that edge show a part of the frame on the
right.
