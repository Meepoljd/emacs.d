<p><a name="index-side-windows-2777"></a><a name="index-main-window-2778"></a><a name="index-main-window-of-a-frame-2779"></a>
Side windows are special windows positioned at any of the four sides of
a frame's root window (see <a href="Windows-and-Frames.html#Windows-and-Frames">Windows and Frames</a>).  In practice, this
means that the area of the frame's root window is subdivided into a main
window and a number of side windows surrounding that main window.  The
main window is either a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; live window or specifies the area
containing all the normal windows.

   <p>In their most simple form of use, side windows allow to display
specific buffers always in the same area of a frame.  Hence they can be
regarded as a generalization of the concept provided by
<code>display-buffer-at-bottom</code> (see <a href="Display-Action-Functions.html#Display-Action-Functions">Display Action Functions</a>) to
the remaining sides of a frame.  With suitable customizations, however,
side windows can be also used to provide frame layouts similar to those
found in so-called integrated development environments (IDEs).
